By News Desk @bactiman63

The World Health Organization (WHO) reports one new case of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus in China during the first week of 2021.

The case was a 1-year-and 4-month-old male from Yunfu, Guangdong Province, China, who had exposure to domestic poultry prior to the onset of illness. He developed mild symptoms on 28 December, 2020 and was admitted to a hospital on 29 December. As of 4 January 2021, no family cluster was reported. This is the first case to be reported from China in 2021.

In addition, six new cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) virus were reported on Dec. 9, 2020.

The cases were retrospectively detected through Influenzalike illness Surveillance (ILI) between July 2019 and December 2020. No deaths were reported among the reported cases and all six reported mild symptoms. Five of the cases had exposure to poultry and one case had no clear poultry exposure. No family clusters were reported from any of the six cases. In 2020, there were thirteen cases reported from China. A total of 42 cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H9N2) in China have been reported since December 2015.



",50 Shades of Fear Haunt China’s Distressed Developers,https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-01-17/china-s-high-yield-bond-market-is-rocked-by-more-fear-and-further-selloffs,"The novel 50 Shades of Grey reminded readers that the spectrum of pleasure can extend into sadomasochism and pain. One may argue that China’s high-yield bond market can drag investors through a different range of sensations in the search for profit: Many things can go wrong, and we’ve got plenty of reasons to fear.

Take real estate developers, for example. This January’s selloff has a very different feel from September’s. Back then, the trigger was what seemed to be a letter by China Evergrande Group, China’s most indebted developer, sent to the Guangdong municipal government warning of an impending cash crunch. Evergrande said the letter was fabricated, yet its bonds nonetheless led the sector’s broader decline as investors sifted through company financials.

This time around, the selloff seems to be stemming from developers with deep state ties. Last week, notes issued by China Fortune Land Development Co., China’s largest industrial park developer, slumped to record lows. Greenland Holdings Corp., a state-owned enterprise based in Shanghai, also witnessed big, downward moves. Meanwhile, billionaire Hui Ka Yan’s Evergrande, while no longer the immediate focus of investor concern, continues to require urgent refinancing of its own: A gigantic HK$16.2 billion ($2.1 billion) convertible bond is puttable on Feb. 14.  

So what’s causing the shift in market focus? Why are investors recasting their scrutiny to state-affiliated developers?

Will ‘Running the Economy Hot’ Really Help Workers?
Tinker, Tailor, Soldier On: Takeaways From the BOJ's Policy Review
Why Switzerland Trails West Virginia in Vaccines
Blame last November’s ugly wave of state-owned enterprises’ defaults. In less than one month, three unrelated companies — an auto giant in the northeast, a coal miner in the affluent Henan province, and a chip manufacturing powerhouse — shifted quality assets out while defaulting. Now, there’s a perception in the marketplace that SOEs, and their local governments, will try to squirm out of their obligations. There are no more bailouts, and the recovery rate — that is, how much money investors expect to claw back — can be much lower at SOEs.
Consider China Fortune Land, the company currently in the eye of the storm. This mid-sized developer is not an SOE, but it does a lot of business with local governments. Through public-private partnerships, as of September 2019, it had built nearly 80 new industrial parks, signing up over 3,000 enterprises to relocate into them. But these projects tend to come into fruition long-term: Municipalities don’t make any upfront investments, and repay only when fiscal revenue is generated. As China Fortune Land built industrial parks for local governments, the account receivables at the developer ballooned to 54.8 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) as of September 2020, a 41% jump from a year earlier.
So here’s an indecent proposition: Suppose some of these industrial parks are ghost towns that can’t churn out a penny for municipalities that have contracted the projects with China Fortune? How healthy then are the developer’s balance sheets? If we make the extreme assumption that China Fortune can’t get any of its receivables back, its net-debt-to-equity ratio would soar to 263%, even higher than Evergrande’s, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.

Just like everyone else, Beijing wanted a reset in the New Year. In late December, it tried to clean up the lingering problems from the SOE defaults. It punished the rating agency that gave the defaulted coal miner a coveted AAA rating, and probed Haitong Securities Co., the miner’s investment bank, for bond market manipulations. Meanwhile, Brilliance Auto Group Holdings Co.’s controversial move to shield core assets from creditors after its default has been reversed.

But it’s not that easy to move on. These policy maneuvers were not enough, it turns out. As soon as bond traders returned from their holidays, the very first thing they did was pare back their exposure to companies servicing the state. You can’t order market forces to behave when they are fueled by fear.

As anyone who’s been to business school knows, a company’s creditworthiness depends on two things: its ability to pay, and its willingness to pay. Last fall, investors fretted over Evergrande’s ability to pay. This winter, they are worried about China Inc.’s will to service debt. That’s a stigma almost impossible to erase. As a result, investors are being dragged from one torture chamber to another – shades I bet most of them do not enjoy."

In total, 31 cases of salmonellosis have been detected by the National Reference Center for Salmonella at Institut Pasteur. Illness because of Salmonella Bovismorbificans has mostly affected young people with at least 17 children sick.

Strains were isolated from patients between Sept. 22 and Nov. 14, 2020. The onset of symptoms ranged from Sept. 22 to Nov. 10.

Patients live in seven different parts of the country while the Grand-Est region has the most cases with 16. Fourteen men and 17 women have been confirmed sick, ranging in age from 1 to 69 years old. Seven patients were hospitalized but no deaths reported.

Investigation findings

Almost all patients had eaten dried pork sausage of one brand bought in several locations of the same supermarket chain, according to Sant√© publique France.

The link between illness and eating dry cold meats manufactured by France Salaisons was previously made by the Directorate General for Food (DGAL), Directorate General for Health and Sant√© publique France. The company is based in the Rhone region of France.

Potentially contaminated product has also been recalled in Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal and Slovenia.

In France, a withdrawal and recall of several batches of dry sausage of the Saint Azay brand sold at E. Leclerc stores has taken place.

France Salaisons also withdrew and recalled certain lots and dates of rosette de Lyon 15 slices of the Saint Alby brand and rosette pre-sliced in 15 slices of the Le Flutiau make. Monterrat used rosette manufactured by France Salaisons on some club rosette sandwiches, prompting a recall.

About Salmonella infections

Food contaminated with Salmonella bacteria does not usually look, smell, or taste spoiled. Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection. Infants, children, seniors, and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are fragile, according to the CDC.

Anyone who has eaten any recalled products and developed symptoms of Salmonella infection should seek medical attention. Sick people should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to Salmonella bacteria because special tests are necessary to diagnose salmonellosis. Salmonella infection symptoms can mimic other illnesses, frequently leading to misdiagnosis.

Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Otherwise, healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. In some cases, however, diarrhea may be so severe that patients require hospitalization.

Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions. Some people get infected without getting sick or showing any symptoms. However, they may still spread the infections to others.

By NewsDesk @bactiman63

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a travel notice recently for Vietnam due to a diphtheria outbreak.

Health officials in Vietnam have reported an outbreak of diphtheria in the Central Highlands region.

National health authorities have reported 198 diphtheria cases since the beginning of this year. Of the 198 cases, 172 cases have been reported in the Central Highland region, 22 cases in central provinces and four cases in southern provinces.

In response to the outbreak, the Vietnam Ministry of Health has launched a vaccination campaign for affected provinces and implemented several measures to help prevent and control the spread of the disease.

CDC says travelers to Vietnam should make sure they are up to date with diphtheria vaccination.

Diphtheria is a bacterial disease that causes respiratory tract and skin infections. It can spread from person to person by coughing, sneezing, and through contact with infected skin sores.

Diphtheria bacteria make a toxin (poison) that kills healthy tissues in the respiratory system. Within two to three days, the dead tissue forms a thick, gray coating that can build up in the throat or nose making it very hard to breathe and swallow. If the toxin gets into the blood stream, it can cause heart, nerve, and kidney damage.



",Dozens killed in floods across Southeast Asia as tropical storm Nangka approaches,https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/13/asia/vietnam-cambodia-nangka-intl-hnk/index.html,"(CNN) Nearly 40 people have died in Vietnam and Cambodia and scores more were missing, including rescuers, due to prolonged heavy rain and flash flooding as tropical storm Nangka edged towards the Vietnamese coast on Tuesday.

Heavy rains since early October have caused deadly floods and landslides in several provinces in central Vietnam and displaced thousands of people in western Cambodia, officials and state media said.

The floods are expected to worsen over the coming days, with tropical storm Nangka forecast to dump more rain as it makes landfall in Vietnam on Wednesday.

Nangka, packing wind speeds of up to 100 kilometers per hour (62 miles per hour), will trigger heavy rain of up to 400 millimeters (16 inches) in parts of northern and central Vietnam from Wednesday through Friday, its weather agency said.

Ongoing flooding has killed at least 28 people in Vietnam, and 11 in Cambodia, where almost 25,000 houses and 84,000 hectares of crops have been damaged, according to local media.

9,Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Asia (09): India (MH) Alert,https://promedmail.org/promed-post/?id=20201004.7834726,https://www.afternoonvoice.com/amid-covid-congo-fever-cases-on-rise-city-tabelas-and-cattle-feeders-are-on-high-alert.html,"A rare disease known as Congo fever has claimed its first victims in India. The Palghar district administration issued a ‘Congo fever’ alert after neighboring Gujarat districts reported around four cases of the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), feared to be spreading from animals to humans. The district administration has asked cattle feeders, meat sellers, and staff of the state animal husbandry department to watch out for symptoms that can cause the Congo fever. The virus is transmitted through the bite of the Hyalomma tick, an external parasite, living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, etc.

Jogeshwari’s only ‘Tabela’ owner, Ramanand Tiwary told Afternoon Voice that “the cattle are brought from Gujarat and nearby areas to Mumbai. The sheds here are congested due to space problem, we maintain possible hygiene but still avoiding cattle is not possible’.

Ashish Mulk, a Veterinary doctor from Borivali said “this is not the first time that Maharashtra is facing the threat of Congo fever, it actually returns every year. Surprisingly no major steps are taken to control such hazards”. The onset of CCHF is sudden, with initial signs and symptoms including headache, high fever, back pain, joint pain, stomach pain, and vomiting. Red eyes, a flushed face, a red throat, and petechiae (red spots) on the palate are common. Symptoms may also include jaundice, and in severe cases, changes in mood and sensory perception. As the illness progresses, large areas of severe bruising, severe nosebleeds and uncontrolled bleeding at injection sites can be seen, beginning on about the fourth day of illness and lasting for about two weeks”. This time COVID pandemic has already taken a toll and this is another threat to human lives”.

The long-term effects of CCHF infection have not been studied well enough in survivors to determine whether or not specific complications exist. However, recovery is slow. Animal husbandry department’s deputy commissioner Dr. Prashant Kamble in a circular said the CCHF has been found in some districts of Gujarat. As villages of Palghar district border Gujarat, an alert has been issued. No case of CCHF has been reported in the Palghar district so far. Those with symptoms like headache, high fever, joint pains, abdomen pain and nausea, redness of the eyes, bleeding from the nose have been asked to report to the district administration. Farmers have been asked to ensure the hygiene of cattle sheds, wearing masks, gumboots, and hand gloves.

The district is already tackling growing cases of Covid-19 in rural areas. As of Monday, the district had 34,558 cases of which rural Palghar had 12,279. In January 2011, the first human cases of CCHF in India were reported in Sanand, Gujarat, India, with 4 reported deaths, which included the index patient, treating physician, and nurse. As of May 2012, 71 people were reported to have contracted the disease in Iran, resulting in 8 fatalities.

",Maharashtra: Three booked in Palghar for transporting cattle in cruel manner,https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/maharashtra-three-booked-in-palghar-for-transporting-cattle-in-cruel-manner,"An offence has been registered against three persons in Maharashtra's Palghar district for allegedly transporting cattle into the state in a cruel manner, police said on Tuesday.

The police intercepted a truck at Khanivade toll naka on Mumbai-Ahmedabad Highway on Sunday and found 250 cattle, including goats and sheep, which were being transported in inhuman conditions from Rajasthan, an official said.

While the truck driver managed to escape the scene, the police caught hold of the cleaner, the official said, adding that one of the goats had died in the vehicle.

The police have seized the animals worth Rs 8.40 lakh and also confiscated the truck, he said.

An offence under section 429 (mischief by killing or maiming cattle) of the IPC and relevant provisions of the Cruelty to Animals Act has been registered against Chenna Khan, Gulam Khan and the truck owner, it was stated.

No arrests have been made so far and further probe is underway, the official added."

Researchers at Rutgers University and the U.S. Department of Agriculture‚Äôs Agricultural Research Service (ARS) have found that chlorine dioxide gas is more effective at killing Salmonella on bean sprouts than chlorine wash ‚Äî the industry-preferred decontamination technique. The scientists found that the chlorine dioxide gas was able to reduce the presence of Salmonella on bean sprouts by 99.999 percent, compared to a 99-percent reduction achieved with chlorine wash. Sprouted seeds have a long, and poor, contamination record. The warm, moist environment in which they are grown also provides the perfect growing conditions for pathogenic bacteria, most commonly Salmonella, E. coli or Listeria. Since 1995, at least 51 outbreaks in the U.S. and Canada have been linked to sprouts. Of those outbreaks, 39 were linked to Salmonella. The largest known E. coli outbreak in history was linked to radish sprouts in Japan in 1996. At least 8,500 people were sickened and 12 died in that outbreak. National sandwich chain Jimmy Johns permanently dropped sprouts from its menu in 2012 after a series of outbreaks were linked to sprouts served at its restaurants. Just last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is investigating an ongoing multistate outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis in the Northeast linked to bean sprouts. As of Nov. 24, 68 people in 10 states were known to have been sickened. While the sprouted seed industry has been searching for a surefire way to sanitize its product, cleaning sprouts is tricky because the food is sensitive and any harsh treatment could affect its color or taste. Sprouts are also harder to treat because, as with other fresh produce, the porous, uneven surface of sprouted seeds provides many places for bacteria to tuck themselves away. ‚ÄúThere are areas we don‚Äôt see,‚Äù Dr. Bassam Annous, ARS research microbiologist and lead author of the paper, explained in an interview. ‚ÄúThey look smooth, but really, if you go into the micro level, it looks like mountains and valleys.‚Äù In these valleys, bacteria can be harder get at with aqueous sanitizers because they are protected by trapped air molecules. ‚ÄúIt becomes harder to kill because it‚Äôs living in a protective environment now,‚Äù he said. This is where, according to Annous, gas can be more effective than aqueous sanitizers because it is able to penetrate these protective air bubbles and expose bacteria. Water-based solutions, on the other hand, cannot penetrate these areas. Annous likened it to a wine bottle. If the bottle is full of air, the air must be forced out in order for it to fill with wine. The researchers found that applying the chlorine dioxide gas to sprouts in a tumbler was more effective than applying it to stationary sprouts laid out on the bottom of the chamber into which the gas is funneled. This way, the gas could reach all sides of the sprouts. The sprouts used in the experiment were exposed to Salmonella in a manner meant to imitate what contamination would be like in the real world, Annous said. The scientists used Salmonella strains collected from patients during three past U.S. sprout-related Salmonella outbreaks to make sure that the types of Salmonella they were using were indeed the type that could cause widespread Salmonella illnesses in humans. They soaked the sprouts in a cocktail of the three Salmonella strains for five minutes and then let them sit overnight so the Salmonella grow and develop biofilm, a protective layer that shields the bacteria and provides it with nutrients. The sprouts were then treated with either chlorine wash or chlorine gas, either in a tumbler or not, and for varying degrees of time. The chlorine wash achieved a 2-log, or 99-percent, reduction in Salmonella levels, as opposed to the 3-, 4- and 5.5-log, or 99.99-percent, reductions achieved by the chlorine dioxide gas. Longer exposure times and being in the tumbler contributed to the highest log reductions. ‚ÄúIt gets the job done,‚Äù said Annous of the chlorine dioxide gas. Chlorine wash is currently the recommended best treatment for reducing sprout contamination. The International Sprout Growers Association requires a treatment of chlorine wash and adherence to good manufacturing practices (GMP) in order for growers to be certified by its voluntary quality assurance program. Other options for sanitizing sprouts include heat treatment of seeds, treatment with ozone, a highly reactive form of oxygen, or irradiation. All of these methods significantly reduce, but do not eliminate, pathogens from sprouts, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration‚Äôs sprout safety recommendations. When asked whether or not chlorine gas treatment would be expensive for the industry to implement, Annous said it would be cost-effective in the long run. While it would be expensive to buy and install the necessary equipment, the cost would go down after implementation. Plus, he noted, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a lot cheaper than recalling your product, shutting down your plant and going through litigation if, god forbid, there‚Äôs an outbreak.‚Äù Annous said he‚Äôs working on another research project to design a sealed bag that will release chlorine dioxide gas to treat a sprout once it‚Äôs been packaged, thus providing a kill step after the final stage of production. Evidence shows that sprouts carrying bacteria are most often contaminated in the seed phase, according to FDA. But improper handling during or post-growing has also contributed to contamination. Annous is also working with other researchers to use chlorine gas to sanitize seeds before sprouting. While the bean sprouts used in this study could be treated with gas after sprouting because they are white, he said that green sprouts, such as alfalfa sprouts, would be bleached by the process. However, a seed is much tougher, and treating a green sprout in its seed phase will not compromise its color once it grows. The other authors of the paper include Kit L. Yam and Vara Prodduk of Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Department of Food Science, and Linshu Liu of USDA ARS Dairy and Functional Food Research Unit."

In response to this bacterial disease outbreak, the Fiji Ministry of Health recently announced it ‘is working to manage the situation, increasing disease surveillance, conducting clean-up and awareness campaigns.’

Fiji’s last Leptospirosis outbreak was reported in 2016.

To notify international travelers, the U.S. CDC issued a Level 1 Travel Alert for Fiji on September 25, 2020. ‘Travelers at the highest risk for infection are those exposed to contaminated fresh water while swimming, wading, kayaking, or rafting.’

Furthermore, the risk of leptospirosis increases after heavy rainfall and flooding.

Leptospirosis is also a potential hazard for adventure travelers who spend time around animals, such as veterinarians, animal caretakers, agricultural workers, and humanitarian aid workers.

Leptospirosis is a bacteria that can enter the human body through the skin or mucous membranes, such as eyes, nose, or mouth. People and animals can get infected with Leptospirosis when they are exposed to the urine of infected animals, says the CDC.

They can also get infected from water, soil, or food contaminated with infected animal urine.

Leptospirosis symptoms include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, stomach pain, diarrhea, jaundice, red eyes, and skin rash. Without treatment, leptospirosis can lead to kidney damage, meningitis, liver failure, respiratory distress, and even death.

by fiji meteorological services

Forecasted track map for Tropical Cyclone Ana at 8am today, on 30th January, 2021

Tropical Depression TD05F intensified into a category 1 system and named Tropical Cyclone (TC) Ana early this morning. TC Ana continues to move closer towards Fiji and was located about 175km northwest of Viwa at 9am today. The system is expected to slow down as it moves over the group.

In its anticipated track, the eye of TC Ana is expected to be located closer to the Yasawa Group tonight and approach Viti Levu early tomorrow whilst remaining as a category 1 cyclone.

TC Ana is likely to make landfall over Ra Province around tomorrow morning then continue to move southeastwards over Viti Levu and track close to Kadavu around tomorrow night to Monday morning. Please be advised that damaging winds are likely to begin several hours before the cyclone centre passes overhead or nearby.

Gale force winds has been reported over Yasawa-i-Rara this morning and is expected to affect the rest of the Fiji Group from later today.

Damages to weak structures and houses of exceptionally light materials is expected. It may also cause disruption of electrical power distribution and communication services. Damages to crops and vegetation with trees tilting due to extraordinarily strong winds is also likely.

Heavy rain is expected to continue and become more frequent as TC Ana draws closer to Fiji. This will cause flooding of roads, villages, towns and communities near streams, rivers, and low-lying areas. Due to continuous rain in the last few days causing soil in the ground to become moist and loose, this poses risk of landslides. Therefore, all communities living in flood and landslide prone areas need to remain alert and take precautions when necessary.

Members of the public are advised to keep away from flooded drains, streams, and rivers whilst motorists are also requested to take extreme care when driving as there is risk of poor visibility in areas of heavy rain and thunderstorms.

Moderate swells and breaking waves reaching the coastal areas may cause possible coastal inundation and sea flooding especially during high tide. Sea conditions are too dangerous for sea travel, sailing and other sea activities.

The current situation is closely monitored. Members of the public are advised to remain updated with the latest weather information and adhere to authorities on the ground.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Salmonella bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were likely to share a common source of infection.

A total of 55 people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Stanley were reported from 12 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 21, 2020, to September 19, 2020. Ill people ranged in age from 2 to 74 years, with a median age of 28. Fifty-seven percent of ill people were female. Of 48 ill people with information available, 6 hospitalizations were reported. No deaths were reported.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 35 bacterial isolates from ill people did not predict any antibiotic resistance. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC’s National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is underway.

Investigation of the Outbreak
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback information showed that wood ear mushrooms distributed by Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc., were the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 23 people with information, 22 (96%) reported eating ramen at a restaurant in the week before their illness started. Several people reported eating at the same ramen restaurants, showing they may have been part of illness clusters.

A foodborne illness cluster is defined as two or more people who do not live in the same household who report eating at the same restaurant location, attending a common event, or shopping at the same location of a grocery store in the week before becoming ill. Investigating illness clusters can provide critical clues about the source of an outbreak. If several unrelated ill people ate or shopped at the same location of a restaurant or store within several days of each other, it suggests that the contaminated food item was served or sold there.

Five illness clusters were identified at restaurants serving ramen in three states. Ten (91%) of the 11 ill people linked to restaurant clusters reported eating wood ear mushrooms or ramen containing wood ear mushrooms in the week before their illness started.

FDA and states conducted a traceback investigation from four of the restaurants with illness clusters to identify the source of the wood ear mushrooms eaten by ill people. Traceback determined that Wismettac Asian Foods, Inc., supplied wood ear mushrooms (dried fungus) to these restaurants.

On September 23, 2020, Wismettac Asian Foods recalledexternal icon dried fungus due to possible Salmonella contamination. On October 1, 2020, the California Department of Public Health identified the outbreak strain of Salmonella Stanley in recalled dried fungus samples.

As of November 4, 2020, this outbreak appears to be over.",Indoor Environmental Testing for Pathogens in California and the Rise of Antimicrobial Resistance,https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=269530,"The COVID-19 pandemic has made everyone aware of the ease at which some pathogens can spread. Unfortunately, there are many types of microbial pathogens that can cause disease, and many can be found in both indoor and outdoor environments.

Another growing concern today is the fact that all types of microbes have the ability to develop resistance to the drugs created to destroy them, becoming drug-resistant organisms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines antimicrobial resistance as the ability of microbes to resist the effects of drugs ¬ñ that is, the germs are not killed, and their growth is not stopped. Although antimicrobial resistance through genetic changes can occur naturally over time, the World Health Organization (WHO) states that the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials is accelerating this process. WHO has also proclaimed that antimicrobial resistance threatens the effective prevention and treatment of an ever-increasing range of infections caused by bacteria, parasites, viruses and fungi.

¬ìWhile some people are at greater risk than others of developing serious infections, none of us can completely avoid the potential hazards associated with antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic-resistant infections,¬î said Joseph Frasca, Senior Vice President of Marketing at LA Testing. ¬ìEach year in the United States alone, the CDC reports that millions of people become infected with just bacteria that are resistant to antibiotics, and tens of thousands of cases are fatal as a direct result of these infections. These infections are difficult to treat, requiring costly and sometimes toxic alternatives. LA Testing¬ís laboratories offer environmental testing services for a number of infectious bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses. Testing contaminated surfaces, particularly in places like nursing homes, hospitals and other healthcare facilities with especially vulnerable populations, can be instrumental in confirming that cleaning and disinfection procedures are effective.¬î

As of November 4, 2020, this outbreak appears to be over.",South Africa needs a massive awareness campaign to overcome Covid vaccine hesitancy,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2021-02-10-south-africa-needs-a-massive-awareness-campaign-to-overcome-covid-vaccine-hesitancy/,"(Photo: EPA-EFE / MONIRUL ALAM)

In the face of vaccine hesitancy, trust is a key component. South African public figures have an important role to play as role models and examples to others that receiving the Covid-19 vaccine is imperative for their own health as well as the health and wellbeing of our society.

The first week of February 2021 was a momentous one in the Covid-19 pandemic. It was the week when the number of people globally who had received a vaccine overtook the numbers of people who have contracted the virus thus far. Bahrain currently has the second-highest vaccination rate in the world, while by Saturday, 6 February, the US was vaccinating over a million people a day.

As our health system gears up to embark on a mass vaccination programme in the coming months, it is necessary for the uptake of a vaccine to be as high as possible. A recent survey conducted by researchers at the University of Johannesburg and the Human Sciences Research Council has shown that two-thirds of South African adults would definitely or probably accept a vaccine if one were available, 15% stated they did not know, and 18% said they would not accept a vaccine.

We need a huge national effort to convince members of the public who are eligible to receive a vaccine to accept one. A high level of immunity provided by wide vaccine coverage is the best chance we have to reduce the number of new infections; to reduce symptoms, hospitalisation, and deaths among those infected; and thus to ensure that health services can be freed up to serve people with other health conditions. We need to ensure high enough uptake of the vaccine to provide herd immunity to South African society.

There is, unfortunately, a sense among some in the public that vaccines may cause more harm than good and that vaccines will actually infect people with the Covid-19 virus. This kind of misinformation must be countered from a range of sources ‚Äì government, the medical establishment and the media.

Vaccine hesitancy or vaccine refusal has a long history ‚Äì inevitably tied to charlatans such as Andrew Wakefield, who did serious damage to public understanding of the effectiveness of the MMR vaccine. Wakefield‚Äôs now-discredited study, suggesting that the MMR vaccine was associated with autism in children, was withdrawn from The Lancet because his data were simply false.

We need to guard against baseless claims about any of the available Covid-19 vaccines that are not supported by science. The credibility bestowed on pseudoscience and quackery unfortunately also has a long history in South Africa. Former president Thabo Mbeki argued that HIV does not cause Aids, entertained the quackery of vitamin salesman Matthias Rath, who peddled vitamins to cure HIV, and appointed a minister of health (Manto Tshabalala-Msimang) who believed that beetroot, olive oil and garlic could cure Aids.

Some people are genuinely worried and concerned that a vaccine may harm them. To allay such fears we need accurate information, clear messaging, and excellent science. Lies and misinformation can only be countered by facts, data and solid evidence. Baseless claims and conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccine should be met by these means.

It is likely that all of the 18% of people in the survey mentioned above, that have said they would not take the vaccine, have in fact had numerous vaccines in their life (MMRI, tetanus and others). Far from being sick or disabled from these vaccines, they are likely to be alive today because of them. They need to be reminded of this.

There are a few ways to create conditions for widespread uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine.

In the face of vaccine hesitancy, trust is a key component of making the decision to take the vaccine. South African public figures ‚Äì politicians, celebrities and sportsmen and women ‚Äì have an important role to play as role models and examples to others that receiving the Covid-19 vaccine is imperative for their own health as well as the health and wellbeing of our society. When the public sees leaders and those in the public eye receiving a vaccine, they will be more likely to abandon scepticism and accept a jab themselves.

However, we also know that trust in many politicians in South Africa is currently quite low among the public. In this regard, the role that religious leaders play is key. Every minister, imam and rabbi must publicly be vaccinated and make discussions on the importance of vaccines part of their religious services and ceremonies ‚Äì on an ongoing basis.

Traditional healers have a unique role to play in the effort to ensure the uptake of vaccines. Traditional healers enjoy the trust and confidence of those who seek their services. To this extent, they can help to publicly encourage credulity, acceptance, and trust in the national effort to vaccinate the public.

Social marketing and public service announcements need to start in earnest to create awareness and interest among the public in receiving a vaccine. The fact that the majority of South African adults would accept a vaccine if one were available is encouraging and should be publicised as widely as possible. Doing so will convince those (who are more circumspect) that a vaccine is acceptable to most others, that it is an important social and public health good, and that they should receive one themselves when presented with the opportunity.

We need science journalists on radio, television and print and social media to encourage scientific mindedness in society so that the public can become active readers and consumers of scientific information. Doing so will actively enable people to understand scientific concepts such as prophylaxis, randomised trials and the placebo effect. Understanding the basics of vaccinology is also helpful, as it will help the public to understand that a vaccine cannot actually infect anyone with the virus or change their DNA. Accurate and clear information of this nature can go a long way to counter conspiracy theories about vaccines ‚Äî theories which have no basis in fact.

South African public figures such as President Cyril Ramaphosa, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Stephen Grootes and Siya Kolisi have a duty to publicly and unequivocally endorse and accept the coming Covid-19 vaccine and thus encourage all of us to do the same.

And if community leaders and the professors of the street in every corner of South Africa can do the same, we will stand a chance of vaccinating the numbers of South Africans needed to move through this awful pandemic. DM

All patients have required hospitalization.

People reported eating Minh Chay pate products, which have been recalled nationally, according to the Vietnam Food Administration.

All patients have been hospitalized – five at Cho Ray Hospital and two each at Bach Mai Hospital and Ho Chi Minh Hospital for Tropical Diseases. They became ill from mid-July through Aug. 18.

Initial test results of some Minh Chay pate products, made by Loi Song Moi Company, from different batches detected Clostridium botulinum type B. Patient samples were also positive for Clostridium botulinum.

Incident timeline
On Aug. 19, the Department of Food Safety at the Ministry of Health received a call from the Poison Control Center at Bach Mai Hospital about a couple of people initially diagnosed with suspected food poisoning caused by Botulinum toxin. Both of these patients had Minh Chay pate products with the last time being at the end of July.

On the same day, the Department of Food Safety asked the Hanoi Food Safety and Hygiene Department to work with local authorities to investigate and verify the information.

One day later, the production facility in Dong Anh Town, Hanoi was inspected and issues were found at the company with sanitary conditions such as factory cleaning and drainage. The inspection team told the Health Department of Dong Anh district to suspend production at the firm until problems were fixed and they also took samples of the products.

Patient samples and pate from those being treated at Bach Mai Hospital also became available. Both were positive for Clostridium botulinum and results pointed to contamination during the production process.

Company response
A statement from the company started by apologizing to customers.

“As a brand that comes from a family with a 30-year vegetarian tradition with the desire to convey vegetarian values to the community, Minh Chay always complies with the law. The safety of our customers is Minh Chay’s top priority, we are extremely grateful for your support,” it read.

“Immediately after receiving the direction and guidance of the authorities, we stopped all business and production activities of Minh Chay to coordinate with the authorities to investigate and clarify the cause as well as focus a maximum on customer support resources.”

Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food. However, they can start as soon as six hours after or up to 10 days later.

It can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. It paralyzes respiratory muscles so most patients must be placed on life support. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distention and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.",A more balanced appraisal of Vietnam’s pangasius sector,https://thefishsite.com/articles/a-more-balanced-appraisal-of-vietnams-pangasius-sector,"‚ÄúDoes that mean there are no problems with the industry? Absolutely not. Like any food production system there are going to be concerns but the point is that we have the institutions in place that are able to pick up and deal with those issues as they come,‚Äù he adds.

‚ÄúPangasius is an Asian aquaculture success story and I think the rest of the world should give it a bit more credit for being such an important source of fish produced at such high levels of efficiency,‚Äù explains Professor Simon Bush from the Environmental Policy group at Wageningen University , one of the key contributors to the film.

Produced for Undercover Asia, the documentary - which is now available on YouTube - follows the highs and lows of the sector over the last 25 years. In particular, it looks at the rollercoaster reputation of a fish that has been the subject of often critical media attention over the course of the last decade.

Known as ‚Äúbasa‚Äù and ‚Äúriver cobbler‚Äù in Europe, ‚Äúcatfish‚Äù in the US and ‚Äúdory‚Äù in Singapore ‚Äì there are over 20 pangasius species. After French scientists successfully developed spawning technology for the fish in the mid-90s, the sector took off on Vietnam‚Äôs Mekong Delta. And with low mortalities, a short production cycle and the ability to be stocked at high densities, pangasius soon became one of the world‚Äôs most widely produced whitefish. Vietnam now produces 70 to 80 percent of global pangasius production, generating exports worth $2 billion a year.



However, as the documentary explains, the industry was soon the victim of its own success, as the booming trade in pangasius led to a number of investigations and allegations ‚Äì not all of which were scientifically objective. Indeed, organisations such as the US catfish farmers‚Äô trade body launched campaigns that the cheap imports from Vietnam were grown in filthy conditions, and were full of chemicals and carcinogens. The president of the association even referred to the Mekong as ‚Äúthe toilet bowl of Asia‚Äù.

Such allegations, coupled with several damaging documentaries tarnished the reputation of the sector and caused Vietnam‚Äôs pangasius export markets. For example, the documentary points out, the WWF put it on its ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt buy‚Äù list in 2010, but following an invitation to see the farms, reversed the decision in 2012. Despite this, negative press continued and a sensationalist Spanish film made in 2016 resulted in Carrefour removing pangasius from its outlets.

The new documentary, however, provides a more balanced approach. As well as Professor Bush those interviewed include John Nguyen, from Godaco Seafood and Vi Tam, CEO of Vinh Hoan ‚Äì two of the country‚Äôs largest pangasius exporters.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre still here, it‚Äôs kind of at that moment when some people that don‚Äôt know about pangasius that feel they won‚Äôt eat this but for people who already eating it, they know how good the products are, they know there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the product, they still keep buying. We have loyal customers, we have loyal market,‚Äù Nguyen reflects.

One of the key messages is that the small-scale producers that were the focus of many of the earlier documentaries, are no longer producing pangasius for export, if all. Those small-scale producers who are still in pangasius aquaculture are focusing on the local markets, or have diversified into other species such as lang nha ‚Äì which sells for 10 times the price, but is also produced for the domestic market.

The multistate outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis infections linked to peaches from Prima Wawona that were sold in several regions of the United States and Canada, investigated by the FDA, along with CDC and Canadian, state, and local partners, is over. As of October 15, 2020, CDC reported a total of 101 cases across 17 states. This outbreak resulted in recalls of bagged and bulk, or loose, peaches packed or distributed by Prima Wawona. FDA also worked to publicly disclose international distribution of recalled product from Prima Wawona in an effort to facilitate the swift removal of all potentially affected product from the international market. More information about international distribution of the recalled product can be found in the previously published table below. FDA‚Äôs traceback investigation, which included 18 cases across eight states, identified multiple distributors, packing facilities, and orchards that supplied peaches during the time period of interest. Investigators from FDA, the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) visited Wawona packing facilities and/or orchards that likely supplied peaches to Prima Wawona during the timeframe of interest. FDA‚Äôs traceback investigation is ongoing; however, the cause and source of the outbreak has not yet been determined. Thus far, in an effort to investigate several possible pathways of contamination, FDA has completed over 570 product and environmental sample analyses from multiple facility locations and/or peach orchards, including environmental swabs, peaches and peach tree leaf samples. At this time, sample collection and analysis is underway related to additional peach orchards. A genetic match to the outbreak strain has yet to be identified in any of the samples collected, although a different serotype of Salmonella was detected in one sample collected and analyzed during the investigation. No peaches linked to the positive sample ever reached the marketplace. Although the outbreak is being declared over, FDA will continue its investigation and will communicate any findings that could assist future prevention efforts. Available recall information is included below. Recommendation On August 22, 2020, Prima Wawona recalled bagged and bulk, or loose, peaches that they supplied to retailers nationwide. The recalled products are now well beyond expiration and likely no longer on the market or in consumers‚Äô homes. However, consumers who may have frozen the recalled bagged peaches packed or supplied by Prima Wawona from June 1, 2020 to August 19, 2020 or the recalled loose/bulk peaches packed or supplied by Prima Wawona from June 1, 2020 to August 3, 2020 should throw them away.

Investigation Update

October 15, 2020

FDA investigators, as well as California state officials, inspected four Prima Wawona cold storage and/or packing facilities identified through traceback. Investigators also collected environmental and/or product samples from identified facilities. All samples from these facilities were reported as negative for Salmonella.

FDA investigators also collected a sample of peach tree leaves and peaches. Four out of 40 subsamples of leaves and peaches collected from the orchard were reported positive for Salmonella; however, further analysis of the sample determined that the positive sample result did not match the outbreak strain and therefore does not explain the illnesses associated with this outbreak. Based on the positive Salmonella finding, Prima Wawona acted quickly to prevent potentially affected product from reaching the market.

Although CDC has declared that the outbreak is over, FDA will continue its investigation and is working with the firm to evaluate the efficacy of their food safety measures and develop corrective steps to prevent future contamination events. FDA will communicate any findings that could assist future prevention efforts.

Recall Information (Updated October 15, 2020)

Recalled Peaches

On August 22, 2020, Prima Wawona recalled bagged and bulk, or loose, peaches that they supplied to retailers nationwide.

The firm‚Äôs press states it is recalling ‚Äúbulk/loose peaches distributed and sold from June 1 through August 3 and its bagged Wawona and Wawona Organic peaches distributed and sold from June 1 through August 19th because the products could possibly be contaminated with Salmonella.‚Äù

The bagged peaches were distributed and sold in supermarkets with the following product codes:

It's not secret that the German supermarkets are often cheaper than the UK alternatives but is it enough to get Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons to drop their prices too?

Lidl regularly runs these types of discounts and switches up what's on offer every week, while Aldi runs them every two weeks.

We've had a look around to see if the deals are any good and it turns out that almost all of them are.

Aldi has slashed the price of a four-pack of flat peaches to 45p, which is 4p cheaper than the next cheapest ones from Tesco.

A six-pack of funsize apples is now 59p, which is a 33p less than what they're selling for at Lidl (92p).

Courgettes have also had their prices dropped to 59p. You'll be scoping a bargain on these because the next best thing we could find was at Tesco where they cost ¬£1.

A honeydew melon now costs 59p at Aldi, but it will set you back 99p from Lidl.

But if you're tempted by the low price of 59p for an aubergine at Aldi, you might actually want to head to Morrisons where it's 50p for one.

Aldi's Super Six fruit and veg offers are available until July 18 and they're only available in stores, not online.

This week, Lidl's offers include potatoes, spinach, radish and cucumber in their own brand Oaklands range.

A 750g bag of Jersey Royal potatoes is now 69p down from 99p.

Even when they're not on offer, the spuds are a good deal as the next cheapest bag we could find is from Asda where the same size bag in the Extra Special range is on offer for ¬£1, down from ¬£1.50.

You can also spruce up your salad for less because a 250g bag of radishes costs 39p instead of 59p, and an organic cucumber will cost 59p down from 90p.

Shoppers can also save 20p on a 250g bag of spinach which now costs 69p.

The offers at Lidl are running in stores from today through to July 18 when there will be a new round of deals for the next week.

Are you confused by how much fruit and veg you actually need to eat a day? Here's the low down on what you really need to know.

Earlier this year, Money Saving Expert revealed that shoppers pay up to 54 per cent more to buy fruit and veg loose.

This means that shoppers who want to go plastic-free are having to fork out extra.

The Health Service Executive’s (HSE) Department of Public Health East was notified of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in the Dublin and Wicklow area. To date, 42 cases have been notified; with the onset of symptoms occurring over a 14 day period from July 15.

A food alert was issued by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) and certain batches of mixed salad leaves were withdrawn.

Product recall
The FSAI was notified by the HSE of an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis. An outbreak control team is in place and the investigation is ongoing. Many lines of inquiry are being followed up to identify and control the source of the outbreak, according to the agency.

In early August, all batches and dates of Gold River Quality Mixed Salad Leaves (Seasonal Salad Box) 1 kilogram were withdrawn from sale due to the possible presence of Cryptosporidium. Caterers were instructed not to use the implicated batches from Gold River Farm in County Wicklow.

Most of those ill live in the South Dublin and North Wicklow area. An alert was issued to general practitioners, emergency departments and microbiologists, to increase awareness and recommend testing for cryptosporidium in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, according to HSE.

The Department of Public Health HSE East is continuing to investigate the incident with environmental health colleagues, the Health Protection Surveillance Center, FSAI, and the Department of Agriculture.

About cryptosporidium
As cryptosporidium infection is usually waterborne or via food from contaminated water, it is recommended that the public and those involved in food preparation always follow correct hand and food hygiene procedures. There were 629 cryptosporidium cases in Ireland in 2018.

Cryptosporidium is a parasite that causes the diarrheal disease cryptosporidiosis. Symptoms generally begin two to 10 days after becoming infected. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea but other signs include stomach cramps or pain, dehydration, nausea, vomiting, fever, and weight loss.

They usually last about one to two weeks in those with healthy immune systems. Occasionally, people may experience a recurrence after a brief period of recovery before the illness ends. Symptoms can come and go for up to 30 days. For people with weakened immune systems, they can be severe and lead to life-threatening illness.

Meanwhile, an outbreak of Campylobacter with 11 patients has also been reported in the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow area.

The onset of disease for the first case was July 4 and the outbreak was identified on July 13. Six are lab-confirmed infections. Authorities reported the incident as foodborne as the food item linked to the outbreak was chicken and cross-contamination was a contributory factor.",Lettuce: Is unwashed better than washed? Fresh better than bagged?,https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/lettuce-is-unwashed-better-than-washed-fresh-better-than-bagged-1.3992793,"The great unwashed need not be part of your life any more, unless you want it to be. We‚Äôre talking bagged salads, of course. These tend to come as ‚Äúwashed and ready to eat‚Äù or ‚Äúready to wash‚Äù. A rare packet does not say, but those are best washed. So what does washed mean?

For the consumer, a washed salad saves time and is convenient. For the producer, after the initial outlay on expensive machinery to do the job, it means shelf-life can be up to 50 per cent longer.

Take SuperValu‚Äôs Crispy Mixed Salad from Willowbrook Farm in Northern Ireland. The bag contains ‚Äúgreen and red multi-leaf, lambs lettuce and frisee‚Äù. Helpfully, there is a picture on the back of what each leaf should look like.

Multi-leaf is a type of salad developed to cater for the demand for smaller, softer leaves. It is a favourite with producers because each step in the process, including sowing, harvesting and processing, can be done mechanically. It all helps to keep the price down.

With one slice, the plant splits into small leaves, all of similar size ready to be washed. That is done using a solution containing chlorine to remove any pathogens before being sealed in a plastic bag. (There have been issues with e-coli and salmonella in bagged salad elsewhere, though an Irish survey found local produce conformed to high standards.)

The leaves are then dried and packaged in bags that have low levels of oxygen and higher levels of carbon dioxide. Once you open the bag, the spell is broken and the decay begins.

Country of origin

This added shelf-life, however, means that the salad on sale does not have to be Irish to be ‚Äúfresh‚Äù. Willowbrook Farm is in the North but the bag says nothing about where the leaves are from. When the product is Irish, the packet usually says so loud and clear.

So it is with Tesco‚Äôs Irish Little Gem Lettuce, which has a flag, a Bord Bia Origin ‚Äì Ireland mark and a stamp on the front saying ‚Äúcountry of origin: Ireland‚Äù. Tesco‚Äôs rocket also has a flag, but beware as it is simply ‚Äúpacked in Ireland‚Äù, which means the leaves were put into a plastic bag here. An almost identical product on the shelves in Tesco stores in the UK, which were ‚Äúpacked in the UK‚Äù contain leaves from Italy. This highlights the unwritten rule of provenance: if the produce was grown here it usually states so clearly on the packet. The surprise is that so few of the leaves on sale seemed to be from Ireland.

Florette salad bags don‚Äôt say where the salad is from, but it does note that it is ‚Äúfarmer owned‚Äù, which is encouraging. Those bags also have a ‚ÄúLEAF marque‚Äù hidden on the back of the packaging. This mark indicates that the grower is part of an organisation of farmers who aim to grow the food sustainably and with care for the environment. (LEAF stands for Linking Environment and Farming.) The growers seem to be mainly farmers in the UK and Italy.

Not mentioned on the packet is that Agrial, which owns Florette, has a policy on combating slavery and human trafficking, which are common in the industry.

Nutritional values

What every packet has is a nutrition panel. These serve to highlight the different nutritional value of different salad choices and the importance of mixing it up. Florette‚Äôs baby leaf mix, for example, has almost as much protein as fibre at 2g and 2.3g per 100g. There‚Äôs no fat and just 1g of carbohydrate. SuperValu‚Äôs mixed salad has 2.5g of carbohydrate and just 1.1g each of fibre and protein.

Macronutrients aren‚Äôt the whole point, however. Tesco‚Äôs Watercress, spinach and rocket packet shows that 100g will supply 40mg of vitamin C. An almost identical bag from Lidl brand Meadowlands doesn‚Äôt mention vitamin C, though it is likely to have just as much. It does, however, mention that 80g of the salad counts as ‚Äúone of your five a day‚Äù, a reference to the five portions of fruit or vegetable one should eat to remain healthy.

The very best salad leaves to eat are those you have grown yourself without use of pesticides. Fresh from the garden, they are rich in nutrients and flavour. The next best have been grown locally and are still attached to their roots.

The final option is bagged salads. They don‚Äôt taste as good and, given that they are not fresh out of the ground, will not be as nutritious. They are still a handy option and a reasonable way to add greenery to any diet.

June 9, 2020

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to enoki mushrooms.

Public health investigators used the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that were part of this outbreak. PulseNet is the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC. DNA fingerprinting is performed on Listeria bacteria isolated from ill people by using a standardized laboratory and data analysis method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). CDC PulseNet manages a national database of these sequences that are used to identify possible outbreaks. WGS gives investigators detailed information about the bacteria causing illness. In this investigation, WGS showed that bacteria isolated from ill people were closely related genetically. This means that people in this outbreak were likely to share a common source of infection.

A total of 36 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes were reported from 17 states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each can be found on the Map of Reported Cases page.

Listeria specimens from ill people were collected from November 23, 2016, to December 13, 2019. Ill people ranged in age from less than 1 to 96 years, with a median age of 67. Fifty-eight percent of ill people were female. Of 33 ill people with information available, 31 hospitalizations were reported. Four deaths were reported from California (2), Hawaii, and New Jersey. Six cases were pregnancy-associated, with two resulting in fetal loss.

Investigation of the Outbreak

Epidemiologic, traceback, and laboratory evidence showed that enoki mushrooms supplied by Green Co. LTD, located in the Republic of Korea, were the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the month before they became ill. Twelve out of 22 (55%) reported eating mushrooms, including enoki, portobello, white, button, cremini, wood ear, maitake, and oyster.

FDA and state officials collected enoki mushrooms for testing. The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development collected enoki mushrooms from a grocery store where an ill person shopped and identified the outbreak strain in two samples. These mushrooms were labeled as ‚ÄúProduct of Korea‚Äù and were distributed by Sun Hong Foods, Inc. On March 9, 2020, Sun Hong Foods, Inc. recalledexternal icon enoki mushrooms. The California Department of Public Health collected enoki mushrooms from grocery stores and identified the outbreak strain in one sample. These mushrooms were labeled as ‚ÄúProduct of Korea‚Äù and were distributed by Guan‚Äôs Mushroom Co. On March 23, 2020, Guan‚Äôs Mushroom Co. recalledexternal icon enoki mushrooms. FDA collected samples of enoki mushrooms for testing at import from Green Co. LTD of the Republic of Korea. On April 6, 2020, results showed that two samples yielded the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes. As a result, on April 7, 2020, FDA placed Green Co. LTD on Import Alertexternal icon and H&C Foods Inc.external icon recalled enoki mushrooms supplied by Green Co. LTD.

On March 18, 2020, the Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety published its investigation findings and steps it will take to prevent future illnesses. It found Listeria monocytogenes in enoki mushrooms produced by two firms in the Republic of Korea.

Recalled enoki mushrooms are past their shelf life and should not be available for sale. As of June 9, 2020, this outbreak appears to be over.","How to Use Enoki Mushrooms in Soups, Noodle Dishes, and More",https://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/how-to-use-enoki-mushrooms/,"If you haven‚Äôt grown up with Enoki mushrooms, chances are they look pretty alien to you ‚Äî a cluster of long, thin white stalks topped with little white buttons at the end. They‚Äôre a far cry from the White Button and Portobello mushrooms that the Western world is so familiar with. But in East Asian cuisine, they‚Äôre one of the most commonly used types. If you‚Äôre interested in cooking Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or Vietnamese food, you‚Äôve got to get these mushrooms into your life. Let‚Äôs learn a little more about what makes them so special.

What Are Enoki Mushrooms?

Enoki mushrooms or Enokitake (literally ‚ÄúEnoki mushroom‚Äù in Japanese) is a type of cultivated mushroom consisting of a cluster of long, thin white stalks with white caps. They are also known as jingu (Chinese), paengi beoseot (Korean), and n·∫•m kim ch√¢m (Vietnamese). Enoki mushrooms are a cultivar of Flammulina velutipes, better known as wild Enoki mushrooms, which have shorter stems, are peachy-brown in color, and have large caps. Enoki grow naturally from the stumps of the Chinese Hackberry tree, but may also grow on ash, persimmon, or mulberry trees. The main difference between wild and cultivated Enoki is that the cultivated variety is never exposed to light and grown in a carbon dioxide-rich environment to encourage the growth of long stems.

Enoki mushrooms have a firm texture and mild, fruity flavor. When selecting Enoki mushrooms, inspect the cluster thoroughly. You want a cluster of Enoki that is firm and white ‚Äî avoid anything that appears slimy or discolored. Prior to usage, store them in a paper bag in the refrigerator for up to a week.

Health Benefits

Enoki mushrooms are a rich source of several vitamins and minerals. They contain a decent amount of vitamins B3, B5, B1, and B2 as well as phosphorus, iron, and copper. On top of that, amino acids Tryptophan, Threonine, Isoleucine, Leucine, and Lysine are present. They are also a good source of dietary fiber ‚Äì raw Enoki mushrooms contain more fiber than green cabbage, even ‚Äî and antioxidants such as selenium.

Enoki mushrooms are known to be a non-meat source of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which may help reduce gut fat when combined with their high fiber content. A popular use for them in Japan is to make Enoki ice, pictured above. To make Enoki ice, add 10.5 ounces Enoki (cleaned with the woody stem removed) with just over 1 1/2 cups of water. Then, transfer to a pot and simmer for 30 minutes. Let it cool down, then pour over an ice tray. Enoki is can be used in soups, curries, dressing, and more.

Due to their high vitamin and mineral content, Enoki mushrooms have long been valued in Chinese and Japanese traditional medicine to treat liver disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and stomach ailments.

How to Use Enoki Mushrooms

Enoki mushrooms are at their best when used in East Asian dishes such as soups, noodle dishes, stir-frys, and salads. They can be eaten raw or cooked but should be cleaned prior to usage. To clean your Enoki mushrooms, pick out any stems that are slimy and discolored, then run the cluster under cold water. After that, cut off the woody ‚Äústem‚Äù at the end.

One of the easiest ways to cook Enoki is by making Nametake, or Enoki that have been simmered in soy sauce and mirin, a sweet rice cooking wine. The flavors are the perfect balance of salty, sweet, and umami, plus it keeps for about two weeks in an airtight jar. Nametake is a very popular side dish in Japan and although you can find it jarred in stores (they‚Äôre kind of like pickles), nothing tastes quite as good as homemade. Serve nametake in its own dish as a side or add it to rice, pasta, and soups.

Try using nametake to make a dish called kinoko gohan, or steamed rice with vegetables. Steam the rice like you normally would, but add mirin, sake, soy sauce, and salt. Once the rice is done, top it with green onions and nametake or simply use saut√©ed Enoki mushrooms ‚Äî just cook the mushrooms in a little bit of salt and oil (or use water) until tender.

Or, try nametake with this Macrobiotic Brown Rice Arame. You could also make a full meal spread with nametake, Tofu Steak, Vegetable Teppanyaki, and Blistered Shishito Peppers with steamed rice and Miso Soup on the side.

Cooked enoki mushrooms are a wonderful addition to any soup, particularly noodle soups. Try them with this Kitsune Udon, this Miso Ramen Bowl, or this Somen. Or, try it out with this Grilled Asparagus Pho. Out of all the noodles, it is said that the fruity flavor of Enoki pairs best with the slightly nutty flavor of authentic soba (buckwheat noodles), so give it a try with these Green Tea Soba Noodles, these Carrot and Soba Noodles With Sea Vegetables, or this Zaru Soba, which is especially refreshing in summer.

Toss Enoki into your favorite stir-fry recipe or add it to this Vegetable Udon Stir-Fry, this Easy Lo Mein, or this Chinese Long Bean Stir-Fry.

Finally, raw Enoki is great when tossed in salad, like this Crunchy Vietnamese Vermicelli Salad, this Chinese Seaweed Salad, this Kale and Enoki Mushroom Salad, or any salad.

Where to Buy

Look for fresh Enoki mushrooms at the nearest Asian grocery store. You might also find them at grocery stores that carry specialty items, such as Whole Foods or even at your local farmer‚Äôs market. If you can‚Äôt find fresh, look for dried mushrooms, which only need to be rehydrated prior to use. Otherwise, you can buy Enoki mushrooms online, like these Whole Dried Enoki from SpiceJungle. 4 ounces of dried mushrooms costs about $14.

Seven Seas Ltd. distributed the implicated tune in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Canadian officials report that the recalled fish may actually have been distributed nationwide.

‚ÄúThis recall was triggered by consumer complaints. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is conducting a food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products, according to the recall notice.

The notice had practically no details on the complaints of illnesses.

‚ÄúThere has (sic) been reported reactions associated with the consumption of these products.‚Äù

Canadian officials are urging consumers to check their homes for the recalled tuna products listed below. The recalled tuna should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

Some of the recalled fish was sold without specific labeling.

Food contaminated with high levels of histamine may not look or smell spoiled but can still cause serious illnesses. Histamines are not destroyed by cooking. High levels of histamine in fish can cause a reaction known as scombroid poisoning. Symptoms can include burning throat, diarrhea, dizziness, facial swelling, headache, vomiting and peppery taste in mouth.

Anyone who has eaten or handled any of the recalled tuna should watch for symptoms and seek medical attention immediately if they develop.

Plaintiffs Karen Dhanowa and Nilima Amin, two Alameda County residents, claim in their lawsuit filed last week in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California that Subway has been trying to ‚Äúcapitalize on the premium price consumers are willing to pay for tuna,‚Äù the East Bay Times reported Thursday.

Dhanowa and Amin had samples from several California restaurants analyzed and the filling was determined to be ‚Äúa mixture of various concoctions that do not constitute tuna, yet have been blended together by defendants to imitate the appearance of tuna,‚Äù according to the complaint. However, the complaint doesn‚Äôt say precisely what the lab tests discovered in lieu of tuna.

In a statement, Subway said the accusations are ‚Äúreckless and improper‚Äù and that the company intended to ‚Äúvigorously defend itself.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe taste and quality of our tuna make it one of Subway‚Äôs most popular products and these baseless accusations threaten to damage our franchisees, small business owners who work tirelessly to uphold the high standards that Subway sets for all of its products, including its tuna,‚Äù the company said.

The plaintiffs are represented by Lanier Law Firm of Houston and Shalini Dogra of the Dogra Law Group of Santa Monica. The attorneys did not make their clients available for comment.

According to the suit, the attorneys for Dhanowa and Amin are hoping to get the claim certified as a class action, which would allow other customers who purchased Subway‚Äôs tuna sandwiches and wraps after Jan. 21, 2017, in California to join the case.

The company said the lawsuit seems to be ‚Äúpart of a trend in which the named plaintiffs‚Äô attorneys have been targeting the food industry in an effort to make a name for themselves.‚Äù"
31,El Salvador declares a phytosanitary emergency due to HLB,,https://www.freshplaza.com/article/9192292/el-salvador-declares-a-phytosanitary-emergency-due-to-hlb/,"The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) of El Salvador has declared a phytosanitary emergency due to the Huanglongbing (HLB) pest that is affecting the country's citrus.

The institution has initiated a control and eradication plan for this pest, which consists of taking samples across the country to learn about the situation of citrus plantations and verify the extent to which the productions are affected. In addition, a telephone number will be enabled so that producers can request inspections and technical support.

The plan also involves managing the purchase of reagents to conduct tests and diagnoses, strengthening the laboratory network and prohibiting the sale of uncertified plants, according to a MAG press release.

The presidential commissioner of Operations and Government Cabinet, Carolina Recinos, said that this disease was detected in previous years, but past administrations hid the problem. She said that the current Government will file a complaint with the Attorney General's Office (FGR) to investigate the case. The head of the MAG, Pablo Anliker, said that the pest was first detected in 2013.

The MAG also said that the pest only affects plantations and does not put human or animal health at risk. The fruit also represents no risk of contagion.

The disease has already been officially detected in countries of the region such as Guatemala (2009), Honduras (2010), Nicaragua (2010), Costa Rica (2011) and Belize (2009).

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has temporarily suspended its operations in El Salvador after one of its teams came under attack from an armed gang, the medical NGO said on Sunday.

‚ÄúAll of our medical activities are suspended for the time being, but not canceled, until we can investigate this, and it‚Äôs clear we can carry out our interventions safely,‚Äù MSF said.

MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, said the attack occurred in the municipality of Ilopango on the eastern fringe of San Salvador, as its team was traveling by ambulance in response to an emergency call. Local media described the assailants as suspected gang members.

Members of the MSF team suffered some light injuries and bruises, but no one was seriously injured, the NGO said.

It was unclear what provoked the attack, which was condemned by the government of El Salvador.

Ilopango is regarded as potentially dangerous area in El Salvador, one of a group of Central American countries that has for years battled to keep chronic gang violence in check."
32,13 sick from Salmonella in France linked to eating raw milk cheese,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2020/02/13-sick-from-salmonella-in-france-linked-to-eating-raw-milk-cheese/,"Salmonella has affected 13 people in France with a link to consuming a brand of raw milk cheese.

They have been infected with the same strain of Salmonella Dublin, according to the National Reference Center for Salmonella at the Institut Pasteur.

Sant√© publique France and the General Directorate of Food (DGAL) have identified a link between eating raw milk Morbier cheese made by the company Jean Perrin, based in the Cl√©ron commune of Doubs in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© region and those sick. Investigations with the producer are underway to identify the cause of contamination and take corrective actions.

SA Perrin has withdrawn from sale and recalled several lots and dates of Morbier cheese.

Products are sold in the traditional and self-service departments of supermarkets throughout France and can be identified by the approval number FR 25-155-001 CE on the cheese or packaging.

Authorities advised people that have the potentially affected products not to consume them and to take them back to the place of purchase.

Nine hospitalized and three deaths

Eight men and five women with a median age of 72 have fallen ill from late November 2019 up to early January this year. Cases are spread across seven regions of France and nine people needed hospital treatment.

Three people have died but it is not clear what role salmonellosis played in the deaths, according to Sant√© publique France.

Most cases reported having eaten raw milk Morbier cheese bought in different stores before their symptoms began. Analysis by DGAL of cheese purchases from loyalty cards of the cases made it possible to identify that the Morbier came from the same supplier.

French authorities are also investigating a foodborne outbreak suspected to be caused by Salmonella Enteritidis in organic eggs from Italy.

Around the same time the alert was posted on the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF), Olivero Claudio recalled organic eggs in Italy due to potential Salmonella Enteritidis contamination.

Sant√© publique France, Olivero Claudio and the Italian Ministry of Health have as yet not responded to questions about the outbreak from Food Safety News.

Symptoms of Salmonella infection can include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating contaminated food. Healthy adults are usually sick for four to seven days. Older adults, children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, such as cancer patients, are more likely to develop a severe illness and serious, sometimes life-threatening conditions.

But comt√©‚Äôs real character ‚Äî its fruity, nutty notes and buttercup-yellow hues ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt come from the cellars of a fruiti√®re. And so we arrive at the village of Les Rousses: at the enormous Fort des Rousses, a former military complex whose cold, dark passageways ‚Äî kept a constant 7C by seven-metre-thick walls ‚Äî make it the perfect setting for the next chapter in comt√©‚Äôs story.



‚ÄúEvery cheese is unique,‚Äù says guide Bernard Detrez from JuraFlore, an affinage company based in the fort. ‚ÄúWe put old and young cheeses next to each other as they affect each other‚Äôs maturation, and therefore the taste. Comt√© is a cheese that‚Äôs always evolving. It‚Äôs always different.‚Äù



Passageways snake off in all directions, each one flanked with shelves of cheese that glow like bullion in the dim light. There are 135,000 of them in this building alone, which goes some way to explain the heady, fungal aroma that follows us through the fort.



As Bernard lays out slivers of cheese for us to taste he explains that, by law, comt√© has to be matured for a minimum of four months. The cheeses matured here are aged for at least a year. We tuck in: the 12-month-old cheese is bright and light, with creamy, almost peachy notes, while the nutty 18-monther strikes a balance between mild and punchy. The comt√© aged for 24 months, by contrast, is far richer, woodier ‚Äî truffle, perhaps? ‚Äî and speckled with crystals of amino acid that have hardened over time.

There‚Äôs a difference in the colour, too. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs dark, it‚Äôs made with summer milk, when the cows eat flowers and grasses,‚Äù explains Tas. ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs pale, the milk probably comes from the winter months, when they eat only hay.‚Äù



‚ÄúYou see, no two comt√©s are the same,‚Äù adds Bernard. ‚ÄúIf a customer tells us they loved one particular comt√©, we‚Äôll never be able to replicate it. But I say to them, if you want uniformity, buy Dairylea!‚Äù



Later that afternoon, Tas takes me back to the farm, to another herd for their evening scattering of feed. We cross the field, its grass humming with crickets, and edge closer to a body of water that shimmers in the dwindling daylight.



‚ÄúWelcome to the Lac de Bouverans,‚Äù Tas says, as I watch little fish dart between the reeds. Further out there‚Äôs a paddle-boarder silhouetted against the sun, and a pair of swans drift like paper boats across the surface. ‚ÄúTwo years ago this lake lost nearly all its water,‚Äù he says. It‚Äôs a phenomenon caused by the lake‚Äôs porous, chalky bed, which means in as little as seven days the entire basin can drain itself. ‚ÄúAll you saw here was mud. We managed to save a lot of the fish, which was a miracle.‚Äù



But now, from this little wooden pier, it‚Äôs a scene that‚Äôs hard to picture as clear water quietly laps the shore. As Tas stoops to splash his face, I hear the faraway tinkle of a cowbell. Cicadas roar from the grasses and reeds. Birds chirp. Grasshoppers, too. At dusk, just as at dawn, the Jura begins to sing.

Local specialities

Saucisse de Morteau

Named after the town in which they were first made, these plump sausages are a staple on local charcuterie platters. They get their deep russet colour and distinct, rich taste from being smoked for 48 hours over local fir branches. Traditionally, they‚Äôre strung up and smoked in a tuy√©, a sort of pyramid-shaped chimney.

Absinthe

Good absinthe is a world away from those lurid green, hallucinogenic potions of 19th-century Paris. Fragrant and subtle, the firewater is best drunk diluted with ice-cold water and mixed with sugar to taste. Try the variety from La Fraignaude, an artisan distillery in Frasne, where it‚Äôs flavoured with absinthe flower, black anise and fennel.



Poulet de Bresse

The only poultry with AOP (protected designation of origin) status, the poulet de Bresse might be the world‚Äôs most princely chicken. Since the 16th century, the white-feathered fowl has been revered by everyone from Michelin-starred chefs to French royalty for its succulent texture, golden colour and rich taste, which come from a lavish diet of insects, grass and maize.

Vin jaune

The production of ‚Äòyellow wine‚Äô has been restricted to this corner of the country since the 1930s. It gets its distinctive straw colour from its lengthy ageing process: six years in a barrel beneath a growing layer of yeast. Although this isn‚Äôt a fortified wine, it has a sweet, intense aroma of dried fruit that‚Äôs not unlike sherry or port, and is strong enough to stand up to bold cheeses like comt√© or gruy√®re.

Where to eat

Restaurant du Fromage, Malbuisson

No prizes for guessing the dish of the day at this charming little spot, which is decked out head-to-toe in carved wood and local knick-knacks. Fondue is the way to go here: a bubbling caquelon of local cheeses comes with plenty of bread, potatoes, charcuterie and crudit√©s for dipping. If you can, exercise some self-restraint and leave room for the delicious homemade tarts, cakes and meringues for afters.

The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices (ANMAT) reported those ill are associated with eating ‚ÄúEscabeche de jabal√≠‚Äù 400-gram of the ‚ÄúFatto in casa‚Äù brand with a date of July 1, 2020, produced by Norma Coatti.

A 27-year-old woman and a 30-year-old man are affected and both needed hospital treatment.

An inspection of the production plant by authorities in Cordoba found processing conditions do not guarantee that the product is safe for consumption. The site was stopped from producing and marketing such items for preventative reasons.

The manufacturing firm was asked to recall all units of pickled ‚ÄúFatto in casa‚Äù branded products nationally. These include chicken, pork, Viscacha (a type of rodent), and eggplant.

ANMAT advised consumers not to eat the affected recalled products.

Botulism in Iceland

Meanwhile, a case of botulism has been confirmed in Iceland for the first time since 1983.

The Public Health Institute of Iceland (Landlaeknir) revealed an adult began experiencing symptoms on 12 January with poisoning confirmed a week later.

Local health authorities, the Icelandic Food and Veterinary Authrority (Matv√¶lastofnun) and Matis, a government owned, non-profit, research company, are trying to find the source of the poisoning with no evidence as yet pointing toward food available on the market.

Botulism cases have only been reported in the country three times, first in 1949 when four people became ill after eating pickled beef, in 1981 when a four-person family fell sick, and in 1983 when a mother and child were ill after eating meats.

Common causes are home-cooked foods such as meats, fish, vegetables and fruits, which are usually canned, pickled or fermented and often vacuum-packed.

Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating a contaminated food. However, they can start as soon as six hours after or up to 10 days later.

It can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention.

Causes of a headache and blurred vision will usually have additional symptoms. Some of these conditions can have serious complications, so people should not hesitate to see a doctor if they have severe symptoms.

Almost everyone has experienced a headache, which is pain in part or all of the head. If a headache occurs with or causes blurred vision, it may be due to an underlying condition or medical emergency.

Share on Pinterest A headache with blurred vision can be a symptom of migraine.

A wide range of medical conditions can cause headaches, and dozens of conditions may cause blurred vision.

However, doctors associate far fewer conditions with both blurred vision and headache, especially when they occur at the same time.

Some of the possible conditions that can cause simultaneous headache and blurred vision include:

Migraine

Migraine affects at least 10 percent of the world‚Äôs population. Migraine headaches cause severe throbbing or pulsing pain in a part of the head.

Roughly one-third of those people with migraine also experience visual disturbances, such as blurred vision.

Some of the other symptoms that doctors commonly associate with migraine include:

sensitivity to light and sound

nausea and vomiting

blind spots

tunnel vision

zigzag lines that move across the field of vision and often shimmer

partial or complete temporary loss of vision

objects seeming closer or further away than they are

seeing dots, stars, squiggles, or flashes of light

seeing an aura of light around objects

Visual symptoms of migraine tend to last an hour or less. Most people experience the visual problems before the pain sets in, but they can also occur during the headache itself.

People can typically treat the symptoms of migraine with analgesics, such as ibuprofen and aspirin, or prescription medications, such as sumatriptan or ergotamine drugs.

The sooner someone takes these medications in the course of the migraine, the more effective they usually are.

Low blood sugar

Blood sugar levels naturally rise and fall throughout the day and in between meals.

If someone‚Äôs blood sugar levels get too low, typically less than 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), they become hypoglycemic. Without treatment, hypoglycemia can be very dangerous.

Hypoglycemia can cause headaches and blurred vision when the brain is starved of glucose, which is its primary fuel source.

Other signs and symptoms of low blood sugar levels include:

feeling anxious or nervous

sweating, clamminess, and chills

confusion

feeling shaky

fast heartbeat

dizziness or lightheadedness

irritation or impatience

pale skin

sleepiness

clumsiness or coordination problems

weakness

lack of energy

hunger

nausea

numbness or tingling in the tongue, lips, or cheeks

If someone thinks their blood sugar levels are too low, they may want to consume something with sugar or carbs, such as fruit juice, and check their blood glucose levels if they have an underlying condition such as diabetes.

If blood glucose levels dip below 70 mg/dL, the American Diabetes Association suggest eating 15 grams (g) of carbs, waiting 15 minutes, then retesting glucose levels.

If blood glucose levels are still below 70 mg/dL, the individual can eat another 15-g serving of carbohydrates and repeat the process until levels stabilize.

Once blood glucose levels are back to 70 mg/dL, a person can eat a healthful meal to prevent glucose levels from dropping again.

People whose blood glucose levels go too low may receive a hormone called glucagon. People with conditions that can cause severe hypoglycemia, such as diabetes, may receive a glucagon kit to keep at home. A healthcare professional will teach them how and when to use the kit.

Stroke

A stroke can occur when a blood clot blocks a vessel carrying blood to the brain. This is called an ischemic stroke. Less commonly, a stroke may happen when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures, which is called a hemorrhagic stroke.

Strokes are responsible for 1 out of every 20 deaths in the United States, or around 140,000 deaths, every year.

Strokes can cause blurred vision in one or both eyes and a sudden, severe headache.

Other symptoms often associated with strokes include sudden:

numbness or weakness of the arm, face, or leg, especially on one side of the body

confusion

difficulty speaking and understanding speech

trouble walking, dizziness, and loss of coordination or balance

Without prompt treatment, strokes may cause life-threatening and permanently disabling complications. If a person thinks they or someone around them is having a stroke, they must call the emergency services immediately.

A doctor may give someone who has had an ischemic stroke medication to help break up a clot and improve blood flow to the brain. They may also need to perform surgery to remove the clot.

People who have had a hemorrhagic stroke may require surgery to stop the bleeding in their brain.

Recovery from a stroke can take a long time and will require several forms of therapy. After a stroke, many people also have to take medications to reduce their risk of having another stroke.

Traumatic brain injury

Share on Pinterest Some TBI symptoms may take days to appear.

A traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an injury that interferes with normal brain functioning. A jolt, bump, hit, blow, or penetrating object cause most TBIs.

The specific symptoms of a TBI depend on the part of the brain that the injury has affected and the extent of the damage. Although some signs of TBI can show up immediately, others can take days to weeks to appear.

A concussion is one type of TBI that occurs as a result of a blow to the head.

People with mild TBI often experience a headache and blurred vision. Other common signs of mild TBI include:

confusion

dizziness and lightheadedness

sleepiness

ringing in the ears

a bad taste in the mouth

changes in mood or behavior

sensitivity to light or sound

loss of consciousness for a few seconds to minutes

trouble with attention, thinking, memory, or concentration

a change in sleep habits

nausea and vomiting

People with moderate to severe TBI often experience a headache that continues to worsen and persist. Other signs of a moderate to severe TBI include:

slurred speech

convulsions or seizures

inability to wake up

loss of coordination

loss of consciousness, lasting minutes to hours

persistent vomiting and nausea

numbness or tingling in the arms or legs

increasing confusion, agitation, or restlessness

Severe TBI can be life-threatening without treatment. The treatment for TBI depends on the extent, location, and severity of the injury.

Mild traumatic brain injuries, such as concussions, may only require monitoring and self-care.

People with mild TBI should temporarily limit doing certain activities that can stress the brain or increase the risk of reinjury, such as computer work or playing sport.

People with moderate to severe TBI need emergency care and may require surgery to prevent further damage to their brain tissues.

Carbon monoxide poisoning

Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless, tasteless gas present in the fumes that burning fuel creates.

More than 20,000 people in the U.S. are admitted to the emergency department for accidental exposure to carbon monoxide every year.

When people breathe in carbon monoxide, it binds to hemoglobin, which is the red protein in blood that carries oxygen around the body. When hemoglobin is bound to carbon monoxide, it cannot carry oxygen to organs and tissues.

Carbon monoxide poisoning causes a variety of symptoms as it deprives the body and brain of oxygen. A headache and vision problems, such as blurred vision, are common signs of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Additional symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include:

dizziness

upset stomach and vomiting

weakness

chest pains

confusion

flu-like symptoms

People with mild to moderate carbon monoxide poisoning should get themselves away from the poisonous gas and seek immediate medical treatment. A first responder can provide high-flow oxygen through a mask.

Emergency healthcare teams may give people with severe carbon monoxide poisoning 100 percent oxygen through a tube they put directly into the individual‚Äôs airway."
37,Yellow fever alert issued in southern and southeastern Brazil,,http://outbreaknewstoday.com/yellow-fever-alert-issued-in-southern-and-southeastern-brazil-93072/,"Yellow fever alert issued in southern and southeastern Brazil

With the arrival of summer when the occurrence of diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as yellow fever increase, the Brazilian Ministry of Health is alerting the population to get vaccinated against the disease.

The alert is mainly focused on the population that lives in the South and Southeast regions of the country due to the confirmation of 38 monkey deaths in the states of Paran√° (34), S√£o Paulo (3) and Santa Catarina (1). In total, 1,087 reports of suspected monkey deaths were recorded in the country.

The alert is given because the regions have a large population and a low number of people vaccinated, which directly contributes to the cases of the disease.

The target public for vaccination is people from nine months of age and 59 years of age who do not have proof of vaccination.

Regarding human cases, 327 suspected yellow fever cases were reported in the same period, of which 50 remain under investigation and one has been confirmed.

The yellow fever vaccine is offered in the National Vaccination Calendar and distributed monthly to the states. In 2019, more than 16 million doses of the yellow fever vaccine were distributed throughout the country. Despite this availability, there is a low demand from the population for vaccination. For 2020, the portfolio acquired 71 million doses of the vaccine, enough to serve the country for more than three years.

In 2020, the Ministry of Health will gradually expand yellow fever vaccination to 1,101 municipalities in the Northeast states that were not yet part of the vaccination recommendation area. Thus, the whole country now has the vaccine against yellow fever in the routine of services.

Another change in the calendar was that the children started to have a booster vaccine at the age of four. The decision came because recent scientific studies have shown a decrease in the child‚Äôs immune response, which is vaccinated very early, at 9 months, as predicted in the child‚Äôs National Vaccination Calendar. Since 2017, the Ministry of Health has followed the guidelines of the World Health Organization (WHO) to offer only one dose of the yellow fever vaccine in a lifetime.",Brazil market regulator CVM opens investigation into Petrobras CEO change announcement,https://sports.yahoo.com/brazil-market-regulator-cvm-opens-184229177.html,"FILE PHOTO: Castello Branco, the CEO of Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras, is seen at a ceremony marking his taking over the firm, in Rio de Janeiro

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's securities regulator CVM is investigating the management changes at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, its website showed on Monday, following President Jair Bolsonaro's announcement last week that he will replace chief executive Roberto Castello Branco.

The post on the CVM website gave no details about the investigation, but comes after Petrobras shares plunged more than 20% on Monday following Bolsonaro's announcement.

Under Brazilian securities law, listed companies must communicate important information via securities filings, which did not happen when the president decided to replace Petrobras CEO. He mentioned that in interviews and the nomination of a replacement to current CEO Roberto Castello Branco in this case. Executive changes must be approved by the board of directors, which did not happen here either.

Isabel Kirby, a catcher on her middle school‚Äôs softball team, said it started with what felt like a cramp in her leg on Christmas.

But the next day, Kirby couldn‚Äôt stand on her own, and her worried parents rushed her to Akron Children‚Äôs Hospital, where she was diagnosed with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). It‚Äôs a rare but serious condition that affects the nervous system, specifically the gray matter of the spinal cord, which weakens the body‚Äôs muscles and reflexes.

Health officials have noticed an increase of cases in children occurring every two years since 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And while it often is referred to as a ‚Äúpolio-like‚Äù illness, tests so far have tested negative for poliovirus.

WHAT IS AFM: SHOULD YOU BE CONCERNED?

Symptoms typically begin with sudden onset of arm or leg weakness and loss of muscle tone and reflexes, but can also include facial droop or weakness, difficulty moving eyes, drooping eyelids, difficulty swallowing, slurred speech, and pain in the arms and legs.

Severe symptoms may include respiratory failure, or serious neurological complications, according to the CDC. Parents are encouraged to seek medical care right away if a child is suspected of developing any symptoms.

(Gilles Sabrie/The New York Times)

Written by Steven Lee Myers, Keith Bradsher, Sui-Lee Wee and Chris Buckley

The order came on the night of Jan. 12, days after a new outbreak of the coronavirus flared in Hebei, a province bordering Beijing. The Chinese government‚Äôs plan was bold and blunt: It needed to erect entire towns of prefabricated housing to quarantine people, a project that would start the next morning.

Part of the job fell to Wei Ye, the owner of a construction company, which would build and install 1,300 structures on commandeered farmland.

Everything ‚Äî the contract, the plans, the orders for materials ‚Äî was ‚Äúall fixed in a few hours,‚Äù Wei said, adding that he and his employees worked exhaustively to meet the tight deadline.

‚ÄúThere is pressure, for sure,‚Äù he said, but he was ‚Äúvery honored‚Äù to do his part.

In the year since the coronavirus began its march around the world, China has done what many other countries would not or could not do. With equal measures of coercion and persuasion, it has mobilized its vast Communist Party apparatus to reach deep into the private sector and the broader population, in what the country‚Äôs leader, Xi Jinping, has called a ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs war‚Äù against the pandemic ‚Äî and won.

China is now reaping long-lasting benefits that few expected when the virus first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and the leadership seemed as rattled as at any moment since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989.

The success has positioned China well, economically and diplomatically, to push back against the United States and others worried about its seemingly inexorable rise. It has also emboldened Xi, who has offered China‚Äôs experience as a model for others to follow.

While officials in Wuhan initially dithered and obfuscated for fear of political reprisals, the authorities now leap into action at any sign of new infections, if at times with excessive zeal. In Hebei this January, the authorities deployed their well-honed strategy to test millions and isolate entire communities ‚Äî all with the goal of getting cases, officially only dozens a day in a population of 1.4 billion, back to zero.

The government has poured money into infrastructure projects, its playbook for years, while extending loans and tax relief to support business and avoid pandemic-related layoffs. China, which sputtered at the beginning of last year, is the only major economy that has returned to steady growth.

When it came to developing vaccines, the government offered land, loans and subsidies for new factories to make them, along with fast-tracking approvals. Two Chinese vaccines are in mass production; more are on the way. While the vaccines have shown weaker efficacy rates than those of Western rivals, 24 countries have already signed up for them since the pharmaceutical companies have, at Beijing‚Äôs urging, promised to deliver them more quickly.

Beijing‚Äôs successes in each dimension of the pandemic ‚Äî medical, diplomatic and economic ‚Äî have reinforced its conviction that an authoritarian capacity to quickly mobilize people and resources gave China a decisive edge that other major powers like the United States lacked. It is an approach that emphasizes a relentless drive for results and relies on an acquiescent public.

The Communist Party, in this view, must control not only the government and state-owned enterprises but also private businesses and personal lives, prioritizing the collective good over individual interests.

‚ÄúThey were able to pull together all of the resources of the one-party state,‚Äù said Carl Minzner, a professor of Chinese law and politics at Fordham University. ‚ÄúThis of course includes both the coercive tools ‚Äî severe, mandatory mobility restrictions for millions of people ‚Äî but also highly effective bureaucratic tools that are maybe unique to China.‚Äù

In so doing, the Chinese Communist authorities suppressed speech, policed and purged dissenting views and suffocated any notion of individual freedom or mobility ‚Äî actions that are repugnant and unacceptable in any democratic society.

Among the Communist Party leaders, a sense of vindication is palpable. In the final days of 2020, the seven members of the Politburo Standing Committee, the country‚Äôs top political body, gathered in Beijing for the equivalent of an annual performance review, where in theory they can air criticisms of themselves and their colleagues.

Far from even hinting at any shortcomings ‚Äî the rising global distrust toward China, for example ‚Äî they exalted the party leadership.

‚ÄúThe present-day world is undergoing a great transformation of the kind not seen for a century,‚Äù Xi told officials at another meeting in January, ‚Äúbut time and momentum are on our side.‚Äù

A Party Mobilized

In recent weeks, as new cases kept emerging, the government‚Äôs Cabinet, the State Council, issued a sweeping directive. ‚ÄúThere cannot be a shred of neglect about the risk of resurgence,‚Äù it said.

The dictates reflected the micromanaged nature of China‚Äôs political system, where the top leaders have levers to reach down from the corridors of central power to every street and even apartment building.

The State Council ordered provinces and cities to set up 24-hour command centers with officials in charge held responsible for their performance. It called for opening enough quarantine centers not just to house people within 12 hours of a positive test but also to strictly isolate hundreds of close contacts for each positive case.

Cities with up to 5 million people should create the capacity to administer a nucleic test to every resident within two days. Cities with more than 5 million could take 3-5 days.

The key to this mobilization lies in the party‚Äôs ability to tap its vast network of officials, which is woven into every department and agency in every region.

The government can easily redeploy ‚Äúvolunteers‚Äù to new hot spots, including more than 4,000 medical workers sent to Hebei after the new outbreak in January. ‚ÄúA Communist Party member goes to the frontline of the people,‚Äù said Bai Yan, a 20-year-old university student who has ambitions to join the party.

Zhou Xiaosen, a party member in a village outside of Shijiazhuang, a city of 11 million people that was among those locked down, said that those deputized could help police violations but also assist those in need. ‚ÄúIf they need to go out to buy medicine or vegetables, we‚Äôll do it for them,‚Äù he said.

The government appeals to material interests, as well as to a sense of patriotism, duty and self-sacrifice.

The China Railway 14th Bureau Group, a state-owned contractor helping build the quarantine center near Shijiazhuang, drafted a public vow that its workers would spare no effort. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt haggle over pay, don‚Äôt fuss about conditions, don‚Äôt fall short even if it‚Äôs life or death,‚Äù the group said in a letter, signed with red thumbprints of employees.

The network also operates in part through fear. More than 5,000 local party and government officials have been ousted in the past year for failures to contain the coronavirus on their watch. There is little incentive for moderation.

Residents of the northeastern Chinese city of Tonghua recently complained after officials abruptly imposed a lockdown without enough preparations for supplying food and other needs. When a villager near Shijiazhuang tried to escape quarantine to buy a pack of cigarettes, a zealous party chief ordered him tied to a tree.

‚ÄúMany measures seemed over the top, but as far as they‚Äôre concerned, it was necessary to go over the top,‚Äù said Chen Min, a writer and former Chinese newspaper editor who was in Wuhan throughout its lockdown. ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt, it wouldn‚Äôt produce results.‚Äù

The anger has faded over the government‚Äôs inaction and duplicity early in the crisis, the consequence of a system that suppresses bad news and criticism. China‚Äôs success has largely drowned out dissent from those who would question the party‚Äôs central control. The authorities have also reshaped the public narrative by warning and even imprisoning activists who have challenged its triumphant version of events.

The measures in Hebei worked quickly. At the start of February, the province recorded its first day in a month without a new coronavirus infection.

An Economy Revived

In many countries, debates have raged over the balance between protecting public health and keeping the economy running. In China, there is little debate. It did both.

Even in Wuhan last year, where the authorities shuttered virtually everything for 76 days, they allowed major industries to continue operating, including steel plants and semiconductor factories. They have replicated that strategy when smaller outbreaks have occurred, going to extraordinary lengths to help businesses in ways large and small.

China‚Äôs experience has underscored the advice that many experts have suggested but few countries have followed: The more quickly you bring the pandemic under control, the more quickly the economy can recover.

While the economic pain was severe early in the crisis, most businesses closed for only a couple of weeks, if at all. Few contracts were canceled. Few workers were laid off, in part because the government strongly discouraged companies from doing so and offered loans and tax relief to help.

‚ÄúWe coordinated progress in pandemic control and economic and social development, giving urgency to restoring life and production,‚Äù Xi said last year.

Zhejiang Huayuan Automotive Parts Co. missed only 17 days of production. With the help of regional authorities, the company hired buses to bring back workers, who had scattered for the Lunar New Year holiday and could not return easily since much of the country was locked down at the beginning. Government passes allowed the buses through checkpoints restricting travel.

Workers were only allowed to go back and forth between the factory and dormitories, their temperatures checked frequently. BYD, a large customer, started manufacturing face masks and shipped supplies to Huayuan.

Soon, the company had more orders than it could handle.

Like China itself, Huayuan rebounded quickly. By April, it had ordered nearly $10 million of new equipment to start a second, highly automated production line. It plans to add 47 technicians to its workforce of 340.

Before the pandemic, multinationals were looking beyond China for their operations, in part prodded by the Trump administration‚Äôs trade war with Beijing. The virus itself added to fears about dependence on Chinese supply chains.

The pandemic, though, only reinforced China‚Äôs dominance, as the rest of the world struggled to remain open for business.

Last year, China unexpectedly surpassed the United States as a destination for foreign direct investment for the first time, according to the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development. Worldwide, investments plummeted 42%, while in China they grew by 4%.

‚ÄúDespite the human cost and disruption, the pandemic in economic terms was a blessing in disguise for China,‚Äù said Zhu Ning, deputy dean of the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance.

A Diplomatic Tool

Last February, while the coronavirus ravaged Wuhan, one of the country‚Äôs biggest vaccine manufacturers, Sinovac Biotech, was in no position to develop a new vaccine to stop it.

The company lacked a high-security lab to conduct the risky research needed. It had no factory that could produce the shots, nor the funds to build one.

So the company‚Äôs chief executive, Yin Weidong, reached out to the government for help. On Feb. 27, he met with Cai Qi, a member of China‚Äôs Politburo, and Chen Jining, the mayor of Beijing and an environmental scientist.

After that, Sinovac had everything it needed.

The officials gave its researchers access to one of the country‚Äôs safest labs. They provided $780,000 and assigned government scientists to help.

They also cleared the way for the construction of a factory in a district of Beijing. The city donated the land. The Bank of Beijing, in which the municipality is a major shareholder, offered a low-interest $9.2 million loan.

When Sinovac needed fermentation tanks that typically take 18 months to import from abroad, the government ordered another manufacturer to work 24 hours a day to make them instead.

It was the sort of all-of-government approach that Xi outlined at a Politburo Standing Committee meeting two days after Wuhan was locked down. He urged the country to ‚Äúaccelerate the development of therapeutic drugs and vaccines,‚Äù and Beijing broadly showered resources.

CanSino Biologics, a private company, partnered with the People‚Äôs Liberation Army, working with little rest to produce the first trial doses by March. Sinopharm, a state-owned pharmaceutical company, got government funding in 3 1/2 days to build a factory.

Yin of Sinovac called the project ‚ÄúOperation Coronavirus‚Äù in keeping with the wartime rhetoric of the country‚Äôs fight against the outbreak. ‚ÄúIt was only under such comprehensive conditions that our workshop could be put into production,‚Äù he told The Beijing News, a state-controlled newspaper.

Less than three months after Yin‚Äôs Feb. 27 meeting, Sinovac had created a vaccine that could be tested in humans and had built a giant factory. It is churning out 400,000 vaccines a day and hopes to produce as many as 1 billion this year.

The crash course to vaccinate a nation ultimately opened a different opportunity.

With the coronavirus largely stamped out at home, China could sell more of its vaccines abroad. They ‚Äúwill be made a global public good,‚Äù Xi promised the World Health Assembly last May.

Although officials bristle at the premise, ‚Äúvaccine diplomacy‚Äù has become a tool to assuage some of the anger over China‚Äôs missteps, helping shore up its global standing at a time when it has been under pressure from the United States and others.

‚ÄúThis is where China can come in and look like a real savior, like a friend in need,‚Äù said Ray Yip, a former head of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in China.

China‚Äôs efficiency at home has not translated into an easy triumph abroad. Chinese vaccines have lower efficacy rates. Officials in Brazil and Turkey have complained about delays. Still, many countries who have signed up for them have acknowledged that they could not afford to wait months for those made by the Americans or Europeans."

People across Somerset and Bath have been urged to be aware of the symptoms of scarlet fever after a huge outbreak of the illness across the county over the Christmas period.

A total of 25 cases were confirmed across the county in the final two weeks of December, according to figures released by Public Health England .

It represents a huge rise in the number of cases seen across Somerset - which had seen 14 people diagnosed with the bacterial infection in the previous two weeks .

Ten people caught the infection in Bath and North East Somerset alone over Christmas, with a further five cases being reported in North Somerset and five in Mendip.

There were two cases in South Somerset and Taunton Deane, with a single case of scarlet fever reported in Sedgemoor.

Six people caught scarlet fever in Wiltshire during the festive period, while there were four fresh confirmed cases in Dorset.

A further seven people have been diagnosed with the illness in Bristol.

What are the symptoms of scarlet fever?

(Image: NHS)

The symptoms of scarlet fever include a sore throat, headache and fever accompanied by a characteristic pink red rash that feels like sandpaper.

Your GP can usually diagnose scarlet fever by looking at the rash. Sometimes they may use a cotton bud to remove a bit of saliva from the throat so it can be tested.

Your GP will prescribe antibiotics (or liquid for young children) to take for five or 10 days.

Scarlet fever usually clears up within a week, although the skin may peel for a few weeks after the other symptoms have passed.

The infection is contagious from before the symptoms appear, until:

24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment

up to two or three weeks later if you don't take antibiotics

Scarlet fever is contagious. It's spread in the tiny droplets found in an infected person's breath, coughs and sneezes.

You can be infected if the droplets get into your mouth, nose or eyes ‚Äì either by being in close contact with an infected person, or by touching something that has droplets on it.

To help stop the infection spreading:

keep your child away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment ‚Äì adults should stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment

cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze ‚Äì throw away used tissues immediately

wash your hands with soap and water often, especially after using or disposing of tissues

avoid sharing utensils, cups and glasses, clothes, baths, bed linen, towels or toys

Multistate Salmonella Outbreak, Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurants Sprouts 2018

As of January 18, 2018, eight people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Montevideo had been reported from Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Illnesses started on dates ranging from December 20, 2017, to January 3, 2018. Ill people ranged in age from 26 to 50, with a median age of 34. All 8 were female. No hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Evidence indicated that raw sprouts served at Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurants were a likely source of outbreak.

Federal, state, and local health and regulatory officials conducted traceback investigations from the six Jimmy John‚Äôs locations where ill people ate raw sprouts.

Multistate E. coli O121 Outbreak, Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurants Alfalfa Sprouts 2014

19 Sickened ‚Äì Public health officials in California, Idaho, Michigan, Montana, Utah and Washington collaborated with their federal partners at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate an outbreak of E. coli O121 that occurred in May 2014. A total of 19 people with the outbreak strain, identified by the CDC‚Äôs PulseNet PFGE Pattern Identification Numbers EXKX01.0011/EXKA26.0001, were reported. Among people for whom information was available, dates of illness onset ranged from May 1, 2014, to May 20, 2014. Ill people ranged from 11 years to 52 years old. Seven of 16 victims for whom information was available were hospitalized. None of the confirmed patients developed hemolytic uremic syndrome and no deaths were reported.

Epidemiologic and traceback investigations conducted by public health officials implicated raw clover sprouts produced by Evergreen Fresh Sprouts LLC of Hayden, Idaho as the likely source of this outbreak. Thirteen (81%) of 16 ill people reported eating raw clover sprouts in the week before becoming ill. Ill people in Washington and Idaho reported eating sprouts in sandwiches at several local food establishments including several Jimmy John‚Äôs locations, the Pita Pit, and Daanen‚Äôs Deli.

As part of the investigation the FDA performed a traceback analysis and determined that Evergreen Fresh Sprouts supplied sprouts to seven restaurants with outbreak associated cases. This analysis used documents collected directly from the distributors and the grower, Evergreen Fresh Sprouts, as well as documents collected by the states from the points of service.

The FDA conducted several inspections at the Evergreen Fresh Sprouts facility in May and June. During the inspections FDA investigators observed a number of unsanitary conditions, including condensate and irrigation water dripping from rusty valves, a rusty and corroded watering system in the mung bean room, tennis rackets were being used to scoop mung bean sprouts that had scratches, chips and frayed plastic; a pitchfork used to transfer mung bean sprouts had corroded metal, and a squeegee used to agitate mung bean sprouts inside a soak vat that had visible corroded metal and non-treated wood.

On June 26, 2014, the FDA and CDC held a meeting with the owner of Evergreen Fresh Sprouts to advise the firm of FDA‚Äôs concerns that the seed lot used to row clover sprouts linked to this outbreak might be contaminated and to encourage Evergreen Fresh Sprouts to discontinue using that seed lot. The owner of Evergreen Fresh Sprouts agreed to stop using the suspect lot of seeds.

Multistate E. coli O26 Outbreak, Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurants Alfalfa Sprouts 2012

29 Sickened ‚Äì A total of 29 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of E. coli O26 were reported from 11 states, including: Alabama (1), Arkansas (1), Iowa (5), Kansas (2), Michigan (10), Missouri (3), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (1), Washington (1), Wisconsin (1), and West Virginia (1).

Of the 27 ill people with available information, 23 (85%) reported consuming sprouts at Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurants in the seven days preceding illness. Among 29 ill people, illness onset dates ranged from December 25, 2011, to March 3, 2012. Ill people ranged in age from 9 years to 57 years old, with a median age of 26 years; 89% of The patients were female. Among the 29 ill persons, seven (24%) were hospitalized. None developed HUS, and no deaths were reported.

Preliminary traceback information identified a common lot of clover seeds used to grow clover sprouts served at Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurant locations where ill persons ate. FDA and states conducted a traceback that identified two separate sprouting facilities; both used the same lot of seed to grow clover sprouts served at these Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurant locations. On February 10, 2012, the seed supplier initiated a notification process for sprouting facilities that received the implicated lot of clover seed to stop using it.

Results of the epidemiologic and traceback investigations indicated eating raw clover sprouts at Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurants was the likely cause of this outbreak.

Sprouters Northwest, Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurants Clover Salmonella Sprouts Outbreak 2010

7 Sickened ‚Äì Sprouters Northwest of Kent, WA, issued a product recall after the company‚Äôs clover sprouts had been implicated in an outbreak of Salmonella Newport in Oregon and Washington. At least some of the cases had consumed clover sprouts while at a Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurant. Concurrent with this outbreak, a separate outbreak of Salmonella, serotype I 4,5,12,i- ; involving alfalfa sprouts served at Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurants was under investigation. The recall of Northwest Sprouters products included: clover; clover and onion; spicy sprouts; and deli sprouts. The Sprouters Northwest products had been sold to grocery stores and wholesale operations in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. The FDA inspection found serious sanitary violations.

Multistate Salmonella Outbreak, Tiny Greens Organic Farm, Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurants Alfalfa Sprouts 2010

140 Sickened ‚Äì On December 17, the Illinois Department of Health announced that an investigation was underway into an outbreak of Salmonella, serotype I4,[5],12:i:-. Many of the Illinois patients had eaten alfalfa sprouts at various Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurants in the Illinois counties of Adams, Champaign, Cook, DuPage, Kankakee, Macon, McHenry, McLean, Peoria, and Will counties. The sprouts were suspected to be the cause of the illnesses. On Dec. 21 that year Jimmy John Liautaud, the owner of the franchised restaurant chain, requested that all franchisees remove all sprouts from the menu as a ‚Äúprecautionary‚Äù measure. On Dec. 23, the Centers for Disease Control revealed that outbreak cases had been detected in other states and that the outbreak was linked with eating alfalfa sprouts from a nationwide sandwich chain. On Dec. 26, preliminary results of the investigation indicated a link to eating Tiny Greens‚Äô Alfalfa Sprouts at Jimmy John‚Äôs restaurant outlets. The FDA subsequently advised consumers and restaurants to avoid Tiny Greens Brand Alfalfa Sprouts and Spicy Sprouts produced by Tiny Greens Organic Farm of Urbana, Illinois. The Spicy Sprouts contained alfalfa, radish and clover sprouts. On January 14, 2011, it was revealed that the FDA had isolated Salmonella serotype I4,[5],12:i:- from a water runoff sample collected from Tiny Greens Organic Farm; the Salmonella isolated was indistinguishable from the outbreak strain. The several FDA inspections of the sprout growing facility revealed factors that likely led to contamination of the sprouts.

CW Sprouts, Inc., SunSprout Sprouts, ‚Äúrestaurant chain (Chain A),‚Äù a.k.a. Jimmy John‚Äôs Salmonella Outbreak 2009

256 Sickened ‚Äì In February, Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services officials identified six isolates of Salmonella Saintpaul. Although this is a common strain of Salmonella, during 2008, only three cases had been detected in Nebraska and only four subtypes of this outbreak strain had been identified in 2008 in the entire USA. As additional reports were made, a case control study was conducted; alfalfa sprout consumption was found to be significantly related to illness. The initial tracebacks of the sprouts indicated that although the sprouts had been distributed by various companies, the sprouts from the first cases originated from the same sprouting facility in Omaha, NE. Forty-two of the illnesses beginning on March 15 were attributed to sprout growing facilities in other states; these facilities had obtained seed from the same seed producer, Caudill Seed Company of Kentucky. The implicated seeds had been sold in many states. On April 26, the FDA and CDC recommended that consumers not eat raw alfalfa sprouts, including sprout blends containing alfalfa sprouts. In May, FDA alerted sprout growers and retailers that a seed supplier, Caudill Seed Company of Kentucky, was withdrawing all alfalfa seeds with a specific three-digit prefix. Many of the illnesses occurred at ‚Äúrestaurant chain (Chain A),‚Äù according to the CDC, which generally does not identify specific business.

Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurant Alfalfa Sprouts and Iceberg Lettuce E. coli Outbreak 2008

28 Sickened ‚Äì Several University of Colorado students from one sorority became ill with symptoms of bloody diarrhea and cramping. Additional illnesses were reported. E. coli O157:NM(H-) was determined to be the cause. Consumption of alfalfa sprouts at the Jimmy John‚Äôs Restaurants in Boulder County and Adams County were risk factors for illness. In addition, the environmental investigation identified Boulder Jimmy John‚Äôs food handlers who were infected with E. coli and who had worked while ill. The health department investigation found a number of critical food handling violations, including inadequate handwashing. The fourteen isolates from confirmed cases were a genetic match to one another.

About E. coli infections

Anyone who has eaten any of the implicated products and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention and tell their doctor about their possible exposure to the bacteria. Specific tests are required to diagnose the infections, which can mimic other illnesses.

The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and diarrhea, which is often bloody. Some patients may also have a fever. Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or life-threatening symptoms and complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

About 5 to 10 percent of those diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.

Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among people of any age but is most common in children younger than five years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients.

People who experience HUS symptoms should immediately seek emergency medical care. People with HUS will likely be hospitalized because the condition can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

The only other equipment you'll need is a large (1-2 litre) jar with a lid that's pierced to provide ventilation and drainage.

You can buy purpose-made containers in health food shops or sites like livingfood.co.uk, but otherwise your best option is to adapt a Mason jar ‚Äì one of those wide-mouthed glass containers whose two-part tops consist of a metal disc and a ring that screws on to secure it. Replace that disk with fine plastic or stainless-steel mesh and you're good to go. If that's too much trouble, you can simply stretch muslin across the jar's mouth and secure it with a rubber band. This will create more work in the long term, however, as you'll need to wash the cloth between uses.

Speaking of cleanliness, if you remember the poisonings linked to bean sprouts, here's the NHS's dull but helpful advice: ""You need to use seeds suitable for home sprouting‚Ä¶ Always follow the manufacturer's instructions. Equipment used for sprouting seeds should be cleaned thoroughly using hot soapy water; always wash your hands before and after handling seeds.""

""Seeds suitable for home sprouting"", by the way, means seeds (or grains, or nuts or beans) labelled as such. Don't use seeds that are sold for planting, as these will have been treated with pesticides and other evil substances. We don't have room to list everything sproutable here, but popular choices include chickpeas, peas, radish, red clover, adzuki, quinoa‚Ä¶

Details vary from seed to seed, but in broad terms you need to place the seeds in your jar (leaving it no more than one-third full), screw on the top, then rinse them well with cold water, before adding enough lukewarm water to almost fill the jar. Leave the seeds to soak overnight, then rinse and thoroughly drain them (just turn the jar upside down). Lay the jar on its side, somewhere dark or at least gloomy. After that, all you have to do is keep it at room temperature, rinsing and draining the contents two to four times a day. Once the seeds are fully sprouted ‚Äì probably three to five days ‚Äì make sure they're well drained and put them in the fridge. Use within two or three days."
42,Health warning to Bali tourists after Legionnaires' outbreak,,https://7news.com.au/news/world/health-warning-to-bali-tourists-after-legionnaires-outbreak-c-619240,"Western Australians who have recently been to Bali or are planning a trip to the island are being warned of a potential risk of Legionnaires' disease at Ramayana Resort and Spa in central Kuta.

It comes after the fourth notified case in WA since February.

WA Health Department director of communicable disease control Paul Armstrong said the hotel was linked to earlier outbreaks in 2010 and 2011, which affected at least 13 Australians.

Legionnaires' disease is a severe form of pneumonia, most often affecting older people who smoke or have lung disease, diabetes, kidney disease or a weakened immune system.

Early symptoms include a fever, chills, headaches and reduced appetite.

""Legionnaires' disease is treated with specific antibiotics, and while most people recover, some may develop severe pneumonia requiring hospitalisation,"" Dr Armstrong said.

Originally slated to reopen its border in September, Bali governor Wayan Koster said the process of allowing tourists back would ‚Äònot be rushed‚Äô and ‚Äòrequires careful preparation‚Äô.

Koster added: ‚ÄúThe situation in Bali is not conducive to allow foreign tourists to visit.‚Äù

Indonesia has seen 160,000 cases of coronavirus and just under 7,000 deaths, making it the second-worst hit region in Asia following the Philippines.

The tourism-dependant country has been hard hit, with 70,000 people jobless in Bali alone.

It reopened to domestic tourism on July 1, but many hotels have few guests. As of Monday, Bali had reported 4,576 cases of coronavirus and 52 deaths.

The island saw six million visitors arrive in 2019 and tourism accounts for 80 per cent of its economy, so many have been left devastated by the pandemic.

Koster added: ‚ÄúBali must not fail because it will have a negative impact on the image of Indonesia, including Bali in the eyes of the world, which could have counter-productive consequences for tourism recovery efforts.‚Äù

The Indonesian government also released a statement which read: ‚ÄúThe regulation signed by the Minister of Law and Human Rights that prohibits foreigners from entering Indonesia is still in effect. The Indonesian government will not allow for the entry of foreign tourists to Indonesia until the end of 2020, because Indonesia is still in the red zone category."
50,Almost 50 ill in Australian Salmonella outbreak,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/10/almost-50-ill-in-australian-salmonella-outbreak/,"The number of people ill in a Salmonella outbreak linked to a brand of frozen microwave meals in Australia has jumped to 46.

Public health investigations have found that sick people in New South Wales (NSW), Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) reported consuming the products.

Fifteen Salmonella Weltevreden infections have been recorded in NSW, 12 in Queensland, 11 in South Australia, six in Western Australia and two in ACT. Previously, 15 people were part of the outbreak from NSW, South Australia and ACT.

Production halted

The cause of contamination is still under investigation. Core Powerfoods is assisting authorities in an investigation to confirm the source of the outbreak and has temporarily halted production.

Salmonella will not grow in frozen meals, however it may survive the freezing temperature. If food is thawed incorrectly, such as at room temperature, it will have an opportunity to grow, and if it is not reheated too above 75 degrees C (167 degrees F), it will not be killed, according to Food Standards Australia New Zealand.

Core Ingredients had recalled eight frozen pre-prepared meals with best before dates from Aug. 26, 2020, to Oct. 4, 2020. This has now been extended to include earlier best before dates beginning March 5, 2020.

Items were sold at IGA‚Äôs and Coles nationally, independent retailers in NSW, ACT, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, NT and Western Australia, and a few Woolworths metro stores in Victoria.

Core Powerfoods frozen meals in a 310 or 350-gram pack size of the variety Going Nuts, Deep South Chilli, Muay Thai Meatballs, Holy Meatballs, Naked Chicken, Seismic Chicken, Old School and Smokey Mountain Meatballs are affected.

Renewed warning

NSW Health reiterated a warning for consumers to return or dispose of Core Powerfoods frozen microwave meals.

Keira Glasgow, NSW Health Enteric and Zoonotic Diseases Manager, advised consumers not to eat the products, and either throw them away or return items to the place of purchase for a refund as proof of purchase is not required for recalled food.

‚ÄúSalmonellosis can be quite severe and people sometimes have to be hospitalized to manage dehydration, particularly in young babies, elderly people and those with weakened immune systems. It is important that people do not prepare food for others while they are unwell with salmonellosis and, as a precaution, for 48 hours after symptoms have passed.‚Äù

Glasgow said frozen food should always be cooked thoroughly following manufacturer instructions.

‚ÄúMicrowaves are a quick and convenient way to cook food, however, if they are not used correctly, they can cook food unevenly. When using a microwave to cook food, make sure the food is heated until it is piping hot all the way through.‚Äù

Salmonellosis symptoms include fever, headache, diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. They usually start around six to 72 hours after contaminated food is eaten and last for four to seven days, but can continue for longer.

Why should you take note

The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of Salmonella infections occurring in Ontario and Quebec. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported to PHAC.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage has been identified as a source of the outbreak. Some of the individuals who became sick reported eating Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage before their illnesses occurred. Other ill individuals reported regularly consuming Filicetti brand dry sausages before getting sick. The investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that other sources could be identified.

On October 16, 2019, the CFIA issued a food recall warning for various ready-to-eat dry sausage products that tested positive for Salmonella, including Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage.

Following the October 16th recall, additional laboratory testing of a food sample of Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage was completed. Laboratory analysis has determined that both the recalled Filicetti brand sausage product and the ill individuals in Ontario and Quebec have the same genetic strain of Salmonella.

The CFIA has since identified additional affected products and has issued an updated food recall warning. For additional details on all recalled product names and lot codes, please consult CFIA's website.

Canadians are advised not to eat any of the recalled products or any foods containing the recalled products. Food service establishments are advised not to sell or serve any recalled products, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using recalled products.

The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If additional products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings.

This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Investigation summary

As of October 23, 2019, there are 12 confirmed cases of Salmonella Litchfield illness in the following provinces: Ontario (10) and Quebec (2). Individuals became sick between May and September 2019. One individual was hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 4 and 81 years of age. The majority of cases (58%) are female.

The collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated because of an increase of Salmonella Litchfield illnesses being reported. This is a rare strain of Salmonella not commonly seen in Canada.

It is possible that more recent illnesses may be reported in the outbreak because there is a period of time between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported to public health officials. For this outbreak, the illness reporting period is between 4 and 5 weeks.

Who is most at risk

Anyone can become sick with a Salmonella infection, but infants, children, seniors and those with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of serious illness because their immune systems are more fragile.

Most people who become ill from a Salmonella infection will recover fully after a few days. It is possible for some people to be infected with the bacteria and to not get sick or show any symptoms, but to still be able to spread the infection to others.

What should you do to protect your health

Check to see if you have any recalled ready-to-eat dry cured sausage products in your home. If you do, do not eat them.

Throw recalled products out immediately and properly wash and sanitize any containers that were used to store these products before using them again.

If you have any ready-to-eat dry cured sausage products without the original packaging and are unsure if these products are included in this advice, throw them out just to be safe.

Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds immediately following contact with any of the recalled products.

Do not prepare food for other people if you think you are sick with a Salmonella infection or suffering from any other contagious illness causing diarrhea.

Symptoms

Symptoms of a Salmonella infection, called salmonellosis, typically start 6 to 72 hours after exposure to Salmonella bacteria from an infected animal, person or contaminated product.

Symptoms include:

fever

chills

diarrhea

abdominal cramps

headache

nausea

vomiting

These symptoms usually last for four to seven days. In healthy people, salmonellosis often clears up without treatment. In some cases, severe illness and hospitalization may occur. In some cases, antibiotics may be required. People who are infected with Salmonella bacteria can be infectious from several days to several weeks. People who experience symptoms, or who have underlying medical conditions, should contact their health care provider if they suspect they have a Salmonella infection.

What is the Government of Canada doing

The Government of Canada is committed to food safety. The Public Health Agency of Canada leads the human health investigation into an outbreak and is in regular contact with its federal, provincial and territorial partners to monitor the situation and to collaborate on steps to address an outbreak.

Health Canada provides food-related health risk assessments to determine whether the presence of a certain substance or microorganism poses a health risk to consumers.

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducts food safety investigations into the possible food source of an outbreak.

The Government of Canada will continue to update Canadians if new information related to these investigations becomes available.

UPDATE: September 25, 2019 - Health Canada requests that companies stop distributing ranitidine drugs in Canada while it assesses NDMA; additional products being recalled

Additional ranitidine drugs are being recalled by four companies: Apotex Inc., Pro Doc Limit√©e, Sanis Health Inc., and Sivem Pharmaceuticals ULC. The lots are being recalled as they may have been manufactured using an active pharmaceutical ingredient containing an impurity, N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), above acceptable levels. Please refer to the Affected Products table below for detailed information on the recalled lots.

Should any additional recalls be necessary, Health Canada will update the table below and inform Canadians.

Original Information Update: September 17, 2019 ‚Äì Health Canada requests that companies stop distributing ranitidine drugs in Canada while it assesses NDMA; some products being recalled

Health Canada recently informed Canadians that it is assessing the issue of an impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) detected in some ranitidine drugs. Current evidence suggests that NDMA may be present in ranitidine, regardless of the manufacturer. As a result, and at Health Canada's request, companies marketing ranitidine products in Canada have stopped any further distribution until evidence is provided to demonstrate that they do not contain NDMA above acceptable levels.

The request to stop distribution means that the existing stock of ranitidine products currently available in pharmacies or at retail stores may continue to be sold. This is different from a recall, since products that are being recalled can no longer be sold.

This is an interim, precautionary measure as Health Canada continues to gather information from companies and to assess the issue with other international regulators.

One company, Sandoz Canada, is recalling its oral prescription products in Canada and other countries after testing identified levels of NDMA above what is considered acceptable if the drug were to be taken over a lifetime. Should any additional recalls be deemed necessary, Health Canada will update the table below and inform Canadians.

Ranitidine is available in Canada over-the-counter (for example, under the brand name Zantac and as generics) and by prescription (as generics). Over-the-counter ranitidine is approved to prevent and relieve heartburn associated with acid indigestion and sour stomach. Prescription ranitidine drugs are used to reduce stomach acid for the treatment and prevention of various conditions, such as heartburn, ulcers of the stomach and intestines, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (commonly known as GERD).

NDMA is classified as a probable human carcinogen, which means long-term exposure to levels above what is considered safe could increase the risk of cancer. We are all exposed to low levels of NDMA in some foods (such as meats, dairy products and vegetables) and in drinking water. NDMA is not expected to cause harm when ingested at very low levels.

Health Canada continues to gather and share information with other regulators, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, and with Canadian companies to better understand the issue and whether there may be a risk to Canadians. This includes conducting its own tests and assessing whether the results seen in laboratory tests present a human health risk. The Department will take action if a risk to Canadians is identified, and will continue to inform the public of new safety information.

Health Canada has been working to address the issue of NDMA and similar impurities, known as nitrosamines, found in certain ""sartan"" angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) blood pressure medications since 2018. Health Canada continues to work closely with international regulatory partners to address the issue. This includes broadening its efforts to evaluate the potential for nitrosamines in drugs other than sartans and measures to address and prevent the impurities.

55,Ireland Confirms 23 Typhoid Fever Cases,,https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/xdr-typhoid-fever-has-been-identified-ireland-first-time,"United Kingdom (Vax Before Travel)

The Health Protection Surveillance Centre in Ireland reported an increase in typhoid fever notifications in travelers returning from Pakistan.

According to the Irish authorities on October 9, 2019, there have been 23 cases of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (S. Typhi) in 2019.

This is the first time that cases of XDR typhoid fever have been identified by the national reference laboratory in Ireland.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 12 of these cases had a recent travel history to Pakistan.

Unfortunately, 3 of these 12 cases of typhoid fever with travel history in Pakistan were infected with extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains.

According to the WHO/EMRO bulletin, Pakistan is experiencing a continuous surge of XDR S. Typhi since 2016.

As of August 2019, 10,365 cases of XDR typhoid fever were reported from 23 districts in Sindh province, with the Karachi district being the most affected, having 67 percent of the cases.

Pakistan is the world‚Äôs 6th-most populous country with a population exceeding 210 million people, located in South Asia.

The XDR S. Typhi strain acquired a plasmid that confers resistance to multiple antibiotics, including the first-line antibiotics chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, as well as fluoroquinolones and third-generation cephalosporins, says the ECDC.

The strain remained susceptible to azithromycin and carbapenems.

The increased resistance in typhoid fever limits treatment options and poses a threat to international spread.

In response, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 1 Travel Alert regarding traveling to Pakistan in 2019.

This ‚ÄòPractice Usual Precautions‚Äô Travel Alert published on September 30, 2019, is very important since, in rare cases, typhoid fever can be fatal.

According to the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, about 1.75 million tourists visited Pakistan in 2017 alone.

The CDC says ‚Äòif you are going to South Asia, including Pakistan, protect yourself against typhoid infection by getting a typhoid fever vaccination.‚Äô

The CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends 2 typhoid fever vaccines, an oral vaccine, Vivotif, and an injectable vaccine, Typhim VI.

The oral vaccine Vivotif is approved for people 6 years of age or older and should be taken as directed, at least 1 week before departure.

The injectable vaccine is approved for people 2 years of age or older. Travelers should receive the injectable vaccine Typhim VI at least 2 weeks before departure.

Neither vaccine is 100 percent effective, so travelers should also practice safe eating and drinking while traveling abroad, says the ACIP.

Typhoid fever is a serious disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, spread by contaminated food and water. Humans are the only source of these bacteria.

The incubation period of typhoid and paratyphoid infections is 6‚Äì30 days, says the CDC.

Symptoms of typhoid fever often include high fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, cough, and loss of appetite. People may have diarrhea or constipation.

If you travel abroad and get sick while traveling, seek medical care ASAP.

If you get sick after returning to the United States, seek medical care and tell your health care provider where and when you traveled. Do not prepare food for other people, says the CDC.

An estimated 26 million cases of typhoid fever and 5 million cases of paratyphoid fever occur worldwide each year, causing 215,000 deaths.

Also, the CDC says to ensure you are up-to-date on several vaccinations before visiting Pakistan. These vaccines and related medications can be found at most travel pharmacies in the USA.

From a security perspective, the US Department of State issued a ‚ÄòReconsider Travel to Pakistan‚Äô Level 3 Advisory regarding civil unrest on April 9, 2019.

Moreover, some areas of Pakistan have a ‚ÄòDo Not Travel‚Äô Level 4 Advisory.

Travel Alert news is published by Vax-Before-Travel.",Cheltenham Festival Fever,https://www.sportinglife.com/racing/news/donn-mcclean-raise-the-roof/189285,"Opera Hat never won at the Cheltenham Festival. Actually, Opera Hat only ran at the Cheltenham Festival once, in the 1996 Coral Cup, in which she got no further than the second flight. Winner of the Mumm Melling Chase at Aintree in 1998, Valerie Cooper‚Äôs remarkable mare made Naas her own, winning there nine times, which is why Naas named a race after her.

The BBA Ireland Limited Opera Hat Mares Chase has Cheltenham Festival previous too. Benie Des Dieux won the race in 2018, then went on to win the David Nicholson Mares‚Äô Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival the following month. Of course, they didn‚Äôt have a mares‚Äô chase at the Cheltenham Festival then, but they do now, and Elimay, winner of the 2021 renewal of the Opera Hat Chase on Saturday, is now favourite for it.

The Willie Mullins-trained mare was high in the market for the Mares‚Äô Chase after she ran her stable companion Allaho to three lengths in the Grade 2 Horse & Jockey Hotel Chase at Thurles last month, but she is clear favourite for it now. She was very good on Saturday, competing over the minimum trip, which is probably short of her best.

She got stronger as the race developed. She tracked the two leaders Shattered Love and her stable companion Yukon Lil form early, moved up on the far side to join them at the second last fence, and stayed on strongly from there over the last and up the run-in to go nicely clear under just a hands-and-heels ride from Mark Walsh.

Sixth in the 2019 Mares‚Äô Hurdle at Cheltenham on just her second run for Willie Mullins, JP McManus‚Äô mare won the Louis Fitzgerald Hotel Hurdle at the 2019 Punchestown Festival, and she won her first two races over fences last season. She didn‚Äôt reappear this season until Punchestown in November, when she went down by just a nose to her stable companion Buildmeupbuttercup in a listed mares‚Äô hurdle, and she stepped forward from that to run that big race against Allaho at Thurles three weeks ago.

She is a progressive mare, she is only seven and she has raced just four times over fences. There could be even more to come for her, she should be even better over two and a half miles than over two, and she could run a big race at Cheltenham.

It is correct that Elimay received most of the attention after the Opera Hat Chase, but the performance that Shattered Love put up in chasing her home may have gone a little under the radar as a consequence. Gordon Elliott‚Äôs mare was impressive in winning a listed mares‚Äô chase at Clonmel in November, and you can easily allow her her next run in the handicap hurdle that Flooring Porter won at Navan in early December, given that it was her first run over hurdles in over three and a half years.

She disputed the lead with Yukon Lil for much of Saturday‚Äôs race, until she got a little out-paced on the run to the second last fence. But she did well to stay on as well as she did from the final fence to get up and claim the runner-up spot from Yukon Lil behind Elimay.

The Gigginstown House Stud‚Äôs mare is 10 years old now, but she obviously retains lots of ability. This two-mile trip was obviously too sharp for her, a mare who ran in a Gold Cup and in an Irish Grand National, and who won the Grade 1 Neville Hotels Chase over three miles as a novice. She will be better when she steps back up to two and a half miles, probably her optimum trip, and she won the JLT Chase over the Mares‚Äô Chase course and distance in 2018."
59,XDR Typhoid Fever Outbreak Confirmed in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,,https://www.vaxbeforetravel.com/pakistan-travel-alert-regarding-extensively-drug-resistant-xdr-typhoid-fever-issued-cdc,"Asia (Vax Before Travel)

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 1 Travel Alert regarding the ongoing outbreak in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, of Extensively Drug-Resistant (XDR) Typhoid Fever.

This ‚ÄòPractice Usual Precautions‚Äô Travel Alert published on September 30, 2019, is very important since XDR infections do not respond to most antibiotics, such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone.

And in rare cases, typhoid fever can be fatal.

The CDC says people from the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Denmark, and Australia with a travel history to Pakistan have reported XDR typhoid infections. According to the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation, about 1.75 million tourists visited Pakistan in 2017 alone.

Pakistan is the world‚Äôs 6th-most populous country with a population exceeding 210 million people, located in South Asia.

Pakistan‚Äôs current XDR typhoid fever outbreak began in Hyderabad, which is a city of Sindh province, part of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, during November 2016.

The CDC says ‚Äòif you are going to South Asia, including Pakistan, protect yourself against typhoid infection by getting a typhoid fever vaccination.‚Äô

The CDC‚Äôs Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends 2 typhoid fever vaccines, an oral vaccine, Vivotif, and an injectable vaccine, Typhim VI.

The oral vaccine Vivotif is approved for people 6 years of age or older and should be taken as directed at least 1 week before departure.

The injectable vaccine Typhim VI is approved for people 2 years of age or older. Travelers should receive the injectable vaccine Typhim VI at least 2 weeks before departure.

Neither vaccine is 100% effective, so travelers should also practice safe eating and drinking habits while traveling abroad, says the ACIP.

Typhoid fever is a serious disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi, spread by contaminated food and water. Humans are the only source of these bacteria.

The incubation period of typhoid and paratyphoid infections is 6‚Äì30 days, says the CDC.

Symptoms of typhoid fever often include high fever, weakness, stomach pain, headache, cough, and loss of appetite. People may have diarrhea or constipation.

If you travel abroad and get sick while traveling, seek medical care ASAP.

If you get sick after returning to the United States, seek medical care and tell your health care provider where and when you traveled. Do not prepare food for other people, says the CDC.

An estimated 26 million cases of typhoid fever and 5 million cases of paratyphoid fever occur worldwide each year, causing 215,000 deaths.

In the USA from 2008‚Äì2015, approximately 350 culture-confirmed cases of typhoid fever and 90 cases of paratyphoid fever caused by Paratyphi A were reported each year.

Additionally, during the week ending September 11, 2019, Pakistan confirmed 4 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases and 28 WPV1-positive environmental samples.

And, on September 3, 2019, a total of 7.1 million Pakistani children were successfully administered polio drops, which means they are protected against the poliovirus.

Also, the CDC says to ensure you are up-to-date on several vaccinations before visiting Pakistan.

These vaccines and related medications can be found at most travel pharmacies in the USA.

From a security perspective, the U.S. Department of State issued a ‚ÄòReconsider Travel to Pakistan‚Äô Level 3 Advisory regarding civil unrest on April 9, 2019. Moreover, some areas of Pakistan have a ‚ÄòDo Not Travel‚Äô Level 4 Advisory, such as:

Balochistan province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), due to terrorism and kidnapping.

The Azad Kashmir area, due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict.

The operation was jointly carried out by the Border Security Force (BSF) and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB).

According to people aware of the developments, the NCB got a tip about an attempt to smuggle in drugs from the Pakistan side. The officials laid a trap at the IB.

At around 2:30 am, the team heard some sound along the fence and fired eight rounds from 9 mm Beretta. At 2:45 am, another similar attempt was made in the Amritsar sector and a vigilant soldier of the BSF fired three rounds in the direction of the sound.

During preliminary search, a PVC pipe and 14 packets of contraband were recovered from the first spot. A packet of heroin hanging on the fence and another in a wheat field about 10 metres from there was found at the second.

The soldiers also recovered a body, about 25 metres from the IB. The patrol party had followed a blood trail, which led it to the dead body.

People aware of the development say that the body is believed to be that of a smuggler who tried to run towards Pakistan after getting shot. One mobile phone, one magazine and a pistol have been found in his possession.

A mobile phone was found in possession of the smuggler. (SOURCED)

This comes a day after the BSF troops found a plastic pipe and saw footmarks on both sides of the border fence in Chanmullah, in the Amritsar sector.

An FIR was lodged in connection with the case and area domination beefed up in the wake of dense fog, which has shrouded the area for the past two days.

Such attempts are regularly carried out from the Pakistani side to fund terrorism activities in India, the people cited above said."

A new report from Japan‚Äôs National Institute of Infectious Disease (NIID) indicates the rubella virus outbreak continues to spread.

As of September 4, 2019, there have been 2,156 rubella cases reported by the NIID during 2019.

This is an increase of about 260 rubella cases in Japan since July 2019.

On a local basis, the city of Tokyo has reported 37 percent of Japan‚Äôs 2019 rubella cases.

Since rubella is very dangerous for a pregnant woman and her developing baby, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on August 7, 2019, ‚Äòpregnant women who are not protected against rubella through either vaccination or previous rubella infection, should not travel to Japan during this outbreak.‚Äô

But, pregnant women should not get a rubella vaccination with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, says the CDC.

This is because the MMR vaccine is an attenuated ‚Äòlive virus‚Äô vaccine.

The CDC says ‚Äòpregnant women who are not vaccinated should wait to get MMR vaccine until after they have given birth.‚Äô And, ‚Äòwomen of childbearing age should avoid getting pregnant for at least 4 weeks after receiving the MMR vaccine.‚Äô

Additionally, the CDC says ‚Äòif a pregnant woman contracts the rubella virus, her baby could have birth defects such as deafness, cataracts, heart defects, mental disabilities, and organ damage.

And, when a rubella infection occurs during early pregnancy, serious consequences, such as miscarriages, stillbirths, and severe birth defects in infants, which are known as Congenital Rubella Syndrome (CRS), may occur.

This new NIID report indicates there have been 3 CRS cases in Japan during 2019.

As a comparison, during 2005-2015 in the USA, only 8 babies with CRS were reported.

Moreover, less than 10 people in the United States are reported as having rubella each year. Since 2012, all rubella cases had evidence that they were infected when they were living or traveling outside the United States.

To alert international travelers, the CDC issued a Level 2 Travel Alert regarding Japan‚Äôs ongoing rubella virus outbreak in August 2019.

This ‚ÄòPractice Enhanced Precautions‚Äô Travel Alert says ‚Äòtravelers to Japan should make sure they are vaccinated against rubella with the MMR vaccine before visiting Japan.‚Äô

This CDC Travel Alert is important since approximately 4.5 million USA citizens visit Japan annually.

Additionally, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the UK Foreign Travel Advice recommend ‚Äòpregnant women who are not protected against rubella avoid traveling to Japan.‚Äô

>> Check your Rubella immunity at UltaLabs <<

In the USA, there are 2 approved rubella vaccines, MMR II-Rubella and ProQuad. Both rubella vaccines are available at most pharmacies. Travelers to Japan can request a rubella vaccine counseling appointment with a local pharmacist at Vax-Before-Travel.

Rubella vaccines, like any medicine, can produce side effects. You are encouraged to report vaccine side effects to a healthcare provider or the CDC.

A pregnant sea otter died recently at a southwestern Japan aquarium, leaving only five individuals of the endangered species alive in captivity in the country.

At 9 years old, the sea otter named Mana died Monday at Marine World Uminonakamichi in Fukuoka after her uterus ruptured, according to her keeper.

Mana was raised with her male companion Riro and they were believed to be the only pair living at a Japanese facility likely to produce offspring.

Sea otter numbers crashed due to excessive fur hunting in the 18th and 19th centuries and have been classified as endangered on the Red List of Threatened Species published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Their numbers at zoos and aquariums in Japan have also dwindled to less than one-20th of their peak due to restrictions on the trade of wild animals and the deaths of those in captivity.

According to the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, based in Tokyo, at their peak in 1994, there were 122 sea otters at 28 facilities around the country.

Mana was born at the Fukuoka aquarium in January 2012 and was hand-reared from the time she was 10 days old. She was confirmed pregnant on Feb. 16, but she lost her appetite the following day and died on Monday. The pup was also dead.

""Mana was loved by many people, and has promoted the charms of sea otters. We are extremely disappointed,"" her keeper said.

Sea otters have historically ranged in waters around Japan's northernmost prefecture and in recent years have been seen year-round at Cape Kiritappu on Hokkaido's east coast, leading to hopes of an otter-driven tourism boom as the species recovers."
61,Four ill in Spain with botulism linked to tuna,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/09/four-ill-in-spain-with-botulism-linked-to-tuna/,"Four people are part of a foodborne botulism outbreak in Spain after eating DIA brand tuna.

A batch of canned tuna in sunflower oil of the brand DIA has been removed from sale. The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition (AESAN) said those who became ill ate a homemade salad that included the tuna. Spanish media reported one of the patients was still in hospital.

The foodborne outbreak was suspected to be caused by the tuna or grated carrots from Spain with distribution including Andorra, according to a Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) notice.

AESAN became aware on Aug. 9, through the Spanish rapid information exchange system (SCIRI), of a notification from health authorities in Castilla y Le√≥n of a food poisoning outbreak caused by botulinum toxin linked to consumption of canned tuna in a homemade ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù salad.

Products have been analyzed and the presence of botulinum toxin was confirmed in late August in the consumed can of tuna.

Made for DIA stores by Frinsa

Distribuidora Internacional de Alimentaci√≥n (DIA) is a Spanish multinational company specializing in distribution of food, household and personal care products. The company has more than 6,000 stores in Spain, Portugal, Brazil and Argentina.

Tuna was distributed through DIA platforms to the communities of Asturias, Castilla y Le√≥n, Catalu√±a, Arag√≥n, La Rioja, Murcia, Navarra, Castilla ‚Äì La Mancha and Valencia.

Canned tuna in sunflower oil 900-gram with lot code 19/154 023 02587 and expiration date of December 2022 made by Frinsa del Noroeste S.A. is affected.

This batch of tuna manufactured by Frinsa was removed from all stores on Aug. 10 by DIA, according to a company statement. The firm asked any customers who had the item to return it to their nearest store.

Botulism is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by toxins produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally begin 18 to 36 hours after eating contaminated food. However, they can start as soon as six hours after or up to 10 days later.

Botulism can cause symptoms including general weakness, dizziness, double vision, and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, weakness of other muscles, abdominal distension and constipation may also occur. People experiencing these problems should seek immediate medical attention. Symptoms result from muscle paralysis caused by the toxin.

62,Norway norovirus outbreaks linked to seaweed salad from China,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/09/norway-norovirus-outbreaks-linked-to-seaweed-salad-from-china/,"More than 100 people have fallen ill in Norway from norovirus likely in a frozen seaweed salad from China.

The first outbreak of norovirus suspected to be linked to the seaweed salad occurred in mid-June and the most recent was at the beginning of August. The implicated product was also shipped to Denmark.

‚ÄúIt is suspected that seaweed from China was the cause of more than 100 cases of gastroenteritis from at least 11 eateries in different areas of Norway. Most of the outbreaks were in June and July this year. Investigations are still ongoing. Norovirus was detected in patients from at least two of these eateries,‚Äù Guri Aanderud, senior adviser in the seafood section at the Norwegian Food Safety Authority (Mattilsynet) told Food Safety News.

‚ÄúWe have no information regarding individual cases such as age, sex, place of residence, or hospitalization related to these outbreaks as norovirus is not notifiable in Norway. However, symptoms of norovirus are generally mild and self-limiting. All involved restaurants have received and served seaweed salad from two different lots in the relevant time period. Many of the people who reported illness have stated that they have eaten dishes containing seaweed salad.‚Äù

Product recall

On Aug. 22, Goma Wakame Seaweed salad bags of 1000-gram imported into Norway by √òstlandske Formidling AS (√òfas) were withdrawn from the market due to suspected norovirus.

Product was sold to the food service sector in Norway but distribution may have included several stores across the country. It was imported into Denmark by World Seafood and is produced by Dalian Kowa Foods Co. in China.

Affected bags have item number 8032 and lot number 1904, which was manufactured on March 14, 2019, and lasts until March 13, 2021, and lot number 1811, which was made on November 8, 2018 and lasts until Nov. 7, 2020.

Since withdrawing the product, no further outbreaks linked to seaweed salad have been reported.

The Norwegian Food Safety Authority took product samples that have not yet been fully analyzed and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) has informed the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) via the Epidemic Intelligence Information System (EPIS).

Spanish outbreak and further distribution

Aanderud added it also knew of a Spanish RASFF alert from Aug. 13, 2019 related to a foodborne outbreak caused by norovirus GI and GII in frozen seaweed salad from China, via Germany.

Countries part of this notice include Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain and the United Kingdom.

The International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) was mentioned in both RASFF notifications.

Adam Bradshaw, technical officer in the Department of Food Safety and Zoonoses at the World Health Organization, said INFOSAN was working with colleagues at the European Commission‚Äôs RASFF because the frozen seaweed salad suspected to be responsible for the outbreak was distributed from China.

He added it does not have the authority to disclose non-public information on behalf of countries involved in the outbreak when asked which countries had reported cases and how many.

‚ÄúTo better understand the potential international aspects of this event, we have been in contact with the INFOSAN emergency contact point in China to seek details as to whether the implicated frozen seaweed salad has been distributed from China to any other countries. Once further information is available, we will update all INFOSAN members through the INFOSAN community website,‚Äù said Bradshaw.

Like many other calorie-conscious eaters out there, I thought the fluorescent tangle of greens was a healthier alternative to rice bowls and sushi rolls.

Jun Giovannini, chef at the Mu Fish restaurant in Nova Milanese, near Milan, confirmed that so-called goma wakame is not consumed in Japan. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a Chinese dish, not Japanese,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt is not even healthy, contrary to what people might think, because of how it‚Äôs processed with dyes before being sold.‚Äù

Goma wakame literally means ‚Äúsesame seaweed‚Äù. It‚Äôs hard to trace its exact origins, but it seems the history of the popular side dish pretty much starts and stops at Japanese restaurants in Europe. Japanese food journalist Melinda Joe , who lives and works in Tokyo, said the salad is not only not popular in Japan, but pretty much unknown. ‚ÄúGoma wakame? Like wakame in sesame sauce?‚Äù she asked when I mentioned the dish. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a common way to eat wakame here.‚Äù After I showed her a picture, she said she recognised it, but doesn‚Äôt see it often.

Seaweed salad, or goma wakame in Japanese, is made with undaria pinnatifida, an edible seaweed used widely in Japanese cuisine. On paper, it‚Äôs very nutritious: high in fibre and protein, 45 calories per 100g, plus calcium, iodine and lots of vitamins and minerals. Wakame seaweed is mainly grown and consumed in Japan and Korea. After being ‚Äúfished‚Äù from the sea, the seaweed is blanched to better preserve it. It‚Äôs then sold fresh or dried to be exported abroad.

I also found a few recipes for Chinese seaweed salads that included much more detail. But it‚Äôs hard to verify that the dish actually originated in China.

To make the salad, the dried seaweed is dipped in water, drained, cut into small pieces and then mixed with soy sauce, mirin, sesame, sesame oil, yuzu juice, grated ginger, rice vinegar, chilli and sugar. Online, I found lots of recipes for the dish ‚Äì all very similar. This, coupled with the fact that all the recipes used stock photos and didn‚Äôt mention specifics, made me suspect they were all copy-pasted.

I‚Äôve eaten a lot seaweed salads in my time, and I‚Äôve always found it odd that the taste, look and texture is always so consistent. One explanation is that lots of restaurants have store-bought salads on their menu. Most Asian supermarkets in Italy have ready-made seaweed salad on their shelves, sometimes even frozen and in bulk. The ingredients list on these is full of dyes, added sugar and various preservatives and thickeners, which ‚Äì besides turning this fresh-looking ingredient into a highly processed dish ‚Äì also boosts its overall calorie count.

According to chef Giovannini, wakame seaweed itself is actually a typical Japanese ingredient, eaten as far back as 700AD, in the Asuka period. ‚ÄúWe usually eat wakame in kaisou salads, a dish made with other types of seaweed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúOr we have it on its own with cucumber, avocado or tomato.‚Äù Although the seasoning of these Japanese dishes is similar to the goma wakame we‚Äôre familiar with ‚Äì sesame-oil and sesame-based sauces ‚Äì the appearance and taste are totally different. Wakame can also be stir-fried, added to soups and eaten with sashimi or octopus.

Food scientist and nutritionist, Dr Edoardo Mocini, says people often think Japanese and Asian cuisine is very healthy, but that‚Äôs not necessarily the case. ‚ÄúThe Japanese, for example, eat a lot of salt,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey have higher rates of stomach and oesophagal cancer, which is probably correlated, among other things, with the frequent consumption of alcohol and very hot broths.‚Äù

He also warns about the health halo surrounding sushi, since the rice is often soaked in plum syrup, water and sugar. ‚ÄúFrom a marketing perspective, sushi seems healthy,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúand many are convinced that it has very few calories. But it doesn‚Äôt.‚Äù Of course, this doesn't mean sushi should be considered junk food, but you should think of it as a regular meal out, not as a way to do ‚Äúdo your body good‚Äù, Dr Mocini said."
64,Listeria outbreak in Spain linked to meat product; Salmonella warning issued for Madrid,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/08/listeria-outbreak-in-spain-linked-to-meat-product-salmonella-warning-issued-for-mardrid/,"Spanish authorities have linked an outbreak of Listeria that has affected more than 40 people to a brand of meat.

La Consejer√≠a de Salud y Familias de la Junta de Andaluc√≠a reported those ill lived in Seville and Huelva and became sick in the past three weeks.

The agency connected illnesses to the product by interviewing patients. It has a commercial name of ‚ÄúLa Mech√°‚Äù and is made by the company Magrudis, based in Seville. The item has been withdrawn from sale.

Local media reported that 44 people were affected. Half of them needed hospital treatment.

Previously, 16 Listeria infections were noted in two weeks in the two areas of Spain. Health authorities reported 12 listeriosis cases in Seville and four in Huelva with four people needing hospital treatment.

It can take up to 70 days after exposure to Listeria for symptoms of listeriosis to develop. Symptoms of infection can include vomiting, nausea, persistent fever, muscle aches, severe headache and neck stiffness.

Pregnant women, the elderly, young children, and people who have weakened immune systems are particularly at risk of serious illnesses, life-threatening infections and other complications. Although infected pregnant women may experience only mild, flu-like symptoms, their infections can lead to premature delivery, infection of the newborn or even stillbirth.

Salmonella outbreaks in Madrid

Meanwhile, health officials in Madrid have issued a warning after 14 outbreaks of Salmonella so far this year in the region. La Comunidad de Madrid through the Direcci√≥n General de Salud P√∫blica de la Consejer√≠a de Sanidad focused their alert on foods prepared with eggs such as tortillas or mayonnaise.

In the 14 outbreaks in 2019, 59 people have been affected after eating at home or in catering establishments. Foods most often linked to these outbreaks have been made with eggs.

Officials said most infections can be avoided with adequate hygiene measures such as keeping eggs in the fridge, cooking tortillas thoroughly and eating immediately or storing leftovers in the fridge until they will be eaten and for no more than two days.

Homemade sauces made with raw eggs should not be eaten by vulnerable people, including pregnant women, older people, very young children or people with immune problems.

La Direcci√≥n General de Salud P√∫blica will perform 4,000 inspections and audits during the summer to prevent salmonellosis and other foodborne diseases.

Finally, around 100 people fell sick with Salmonella after attending a festival in early August in Ceuta, Spain.

The Minister of Health, Social Services and Equality, Javier Guerrero, said the food poisoning was traced to one of the booths in the fairgrounds but no infections were serious.

Health authorities carried out 69 inspections at booths and fast food stalls before, on the days of the fair and after as part of the investigation.

He ruled out the presence of other outbreaks in the fairgrounds. Further testing is ongoing to confirm the food source and serotype of Salmonella involved.

Between the beginning of December and the end of January, births fell by 22.6% from the same period a year earlier.

While the definitive data is not in yet, this is the first indicator of the effects of the strict home confinement during March and April of last year, when the babies born in December and January were conceived.

Civil records show that 45,054 newborns were registered during the last month of 2020 and the the first month of 2021, representing 13,141 fewer births than over the same period a year earlier. The figure is based on information from 3,929 registries offering online records, representing 93% of the population.

In the month of January alone, there were 6,889 fewer newborns registered in civil registries across Spain than in January 2020, a drop of 23%. By comparison, between January 2019 and January 2020 the decline was just 1.7%.

This trend is backed by available data from the National Statistics Institute (INE), which shows a sharp decline in births in early 2020 within a larger downward tendency. The year 2019 had already set a record with 360,617 births, the lowest annual number in the historical series that the INE began in 1941. But the first half of 2020 set a whole new record with 168,047 births, a 4.2% decline from the first half of 2019. Full figures for 2020 are not available yet.

The decline in births will add to the overall drop in Spain‚Äôs fertility rate, which has been falling for years and is now an average of 1.23 children per woman, compared with 2.8 in 1975. Women are having fewer children than ever, and having them later in life. And now, with the uncertainty caused by the coronavirus, experts expect the rate to drop even further. Nobody will venture to say by exactly how much, but everyone agrees that the crisis will last beyond a few months.

‚ÄúThe INE will provide the real figure, but the numbers coincide with what we‚Äôd been expecting and what we‚Äôre seeing in other countries,‚Äù explains Diego Ramiro, director of the Institute of Economics, Geography and Demographics at the National Research Council (CSIC). In December, births declined by 21.6% in Italy. In January, they dropped by 13% in France. ‚ÄúIn some US states such as Florida, California or Hawaii, they‚Äôve seen drops ranging from 5% to nearly 20%,‚Äù he adds.

Ramiro believes the decline will also be felt in the May 2020 figures, as people were still under a strict home lockdown. ‚ÄúWe can expect that more children were conceived when the state of alarm ended. But with the second wave [of the coronavirus] there will probably be another delay, and again with the third wave,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a good idea to extrapolate the data from the two months of confinement to the rest of the year, but the drop will likely be sharp.‚Äù

Large hospitals such as Vall d‚ÄôHebron or Sant Pau in Barcelona saw a 10% decline in pregnant patients last year, while deliveries fell by the same rate in January and February of this year. At La Paz hospital in Madrid, there was a 14% drop in first-trimester visits by pregnant women. Other medical centers did not notice a trend change because the birthrate had already been falling before this: Sergio Cast√°n, the head of obstetrics at Miguel Servet hospital in Zaragoza, talks about an annual drop of 5%, while Guillermo Anti√±olo of Virgen del Roc√≠o hospital in Seville says they have seen a 40% decline in baby deliveries over the last 12 years, from 9,000 in 2008 to just over 5,000 in 2020.

The 1918 flu

In terms of the fertility rate, the effects of the pandemic cannot be compared with the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). Alberto Sanz, who teaches political science and sociology at Madrid‚Äôs Complutense University, notes that the number of children per woman dropped dramatically at the time due to a series of factors, including men being sent to the front, numerous deaths, hunger and disease. But that generation had another chance to have kids, since women began bearing children at a young age. Even after the 1918 flu pandemic, the fertility rate rose quickly again at a time when contraception was not common.

But these days, Ramiro of the CSIC is not expecting the rate to spike after the pandemic ends. ‚ÄúBesides the epidemic crisis, we will have an economic crisis and we‚Äôve already seen the effects of the 2008 crisis, which caused a sustained drop,‚Äù he notes. ‚ÄúNow we are heading into a year of slowdown and we will see the lowest fertility rates Spain has ever had.‚Äù

Teresa Castro, a demographer at CSIC, talks about a survey from March-April 2020 where half of respondents said they were delaying their plans to have children while 29% said they were dropping them altogether. ‚ÄúThe greatest fear is job insecurity,‚Äù she notes. ‚ÄúEven if you don‚Äôt lose your job, you‚Äôre afraid of losing it and you decide to wait, because of the expected rise in unemployment and temporary jobs. But the young adults caught by the 2008 crisis already delayed life decisions such as moving out of their parents‚Äô house and forming their own family. We haven‚Äôt yet gotten over that crisis, and now we‚Äôve been hit by this one.‚Äù

Experts note that if there is a fourth wave of the coronavirus and more adverse economic conditions, youths may take even longer to move out. Improved fertility rates will depend on how the economy performs, but nobody is expecting a V-shaped recovery, notes Ramiro. The baby bust is here to stay for a while.

69,Raw sheep's milk cheese linked to French Salmonella outbreak,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/08/raw-sheeps-milk-cheese-linked-to-french-salmonella-outbreak/,"Almost 50 people are ill in France as part of a foodborne outbreak linked to eating a brand of unpasteurized, raw milk sheep‚Äôs cheese.

A spokeswoman from Sant√© publique France told Food Safety News that Salmonella Enteritidis was responsible for 49 illnesses and one person needed hospital treatment.

Those ill are men and women, mostly adults between 22 and 94 years old, but five children were infected. The patients live in five different regions of the country.

The first patients were reported in early June with the most recent reported illness in early July. Two incidents of food poisoning with isolates of Salmonella Enteritidis in patients were declared via mandatory declaration by regional health authorities in Center-Val-de-Loire.

Patients were asked about food consumption and the Salmonella strains isolated from their stools were sent to the National Reference Center of Salmonella at the Institut Pasteur for typing.

All these people had eaten sheep cheese and checks on the cheeses revealed the presence of Salmonella Enteritidis.

Product recall and international distribution

In mid-July, French firm GAEC Froidevaux Cornuet withdrew products from sale as tests detected Salmonella and the epidemiological link to potential human illness.

Implicated raw milk sheep‚Äôs cheese with the name ‚ÄúPur brebis du Lochois‚Äù was sold between May 20 and July 20 this year.

Products were sold directly on the farm, at the Loches market in Indre-et-Loire and at retailers or wholesalers who distributed them at national level.

French authorities advised anyone who had the products not to consume them and to return items to the point of sale where they were purchased.

Distribution also included Austria, Germany and Spain as well as possibly the Netherlands. In Germany, some of the cheese has use-by dates in August and September.

Symptoms of Salmonella infection usually appear 12 to 72 hours after infection, and include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and sometimes vomiting.

The illness can last four to seven days but most people recover without treatment. Symptoms may be more serious in young children, pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly.

Dishes like raclette, gooey macaroni, and pizza topped with fresh mozzarella would be nothing without their rich, creamy cheeses. And for those interested in trying foods from around the world, cheese offers an extensive arena of flavors and textures to experience.

Anyone with a basic knowledge of cheese is familiar with the usual options. Parmesan, Gouda, sharp cheddar‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre used to seeing these at your local supermarket. But no matter how refined your cheesy interests, there are some cheeses you‚Äôll never, ever see in an American grocery store. Why? Because in the U.S., these cheeses are actually illegal.

The Food and Drug Administration has a lengthy and detailed set of regulations on cheese. Most of the banned cheeses are illegal in the U.S. due to the use of unpasteurized milk, or raw milk, in their production. The FDA deems these milks a public health concern. Foodborne pathogens can grow and spread; pasteurization is meant to kill off these germs. There are some cheeses banned for other health reasons, too. You might be surprised to discover the germy (and even flea-ridden) cheeses people eat abroad ‚Äî but that you‚Äôll never find legally in the U.S."
71,Germany reports E. coli cases linked to Egypt,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/07/germany-reports-e-coli-cases-linked-to-egypt/,"The public health institute in Germany has reported more than 30 people have been sick with E. coli this year after going to Egypt.

The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) noted increased reports of Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) related to or after staying in Egypt. Earlier this month, Public Health England also reported an increase in adults and children ill after coming back from Hurghada in Egypt.

In Germany, there are 31 cases of EHEC and five people with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure associated with E. coli infection.

This is significantly more than in the same period of previous years. In 2018, there were 21 EHEC and one HUS case. In 2017, nine EHEC and one HUS case were recorded. The rise cannot be explained by the increase in travel to Egypt alone, according to RKI.

It follows a warning by PHE after 18 people fell ill with Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) infection and one person developed HUS after returning from Egypt this year. Four people needed hospital treatment.

A PHE spokeswoman previously told Food Safety News that it was not an outbreak as a variety of different STEC strains had been detected in visitors to Egypt with STEC O157 and STEC O26 amongst them.

The agency has told the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) about the cases.

Reducing infection risk

E. coli is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated food, such as raw or undercooked ground meat, raw milk, and raw vegetables and sprouts.

The incubation period for E. coli infections can range from three to eight days. Most patients recover within 10 days. Symptoms include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, stomach cramps and sometimes fever.

What caused the German cases is unknown and sick people have stayed at different hotels in separate places, according to RKI, which has informed Egyptian authorities about the increase.

Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said there are precautions that travelers can take.

‚ÄúThese include ensuring meat is cooked thoroughly, not drinking tap water or ice made from tap water and trying to avoid swallowing water when swimming. Anyone suffering from diarrhea and vomiting should ensure they keep well hydrated and seek medical advice if their symptoms don‚Äôt improve within 48 hours. They should also avoid preparing or serving food while they have symptoms and thoroughly wash their hands after using the toilet to stop the bug being passed to others‚Äù he said.

Cairo's tourism ministry says the site, which dates back 5,000 years, would once have been capable of producing 22,400 liters of beer per batch.

In antiquity, the fermented barley juice served as a drink for almost the entire population and was regarded as a staple food. The beer was made from a mixture of water and barley that was heated and then fermented. That mixture was partly seasoned with fruit juice concentrates, filtered and served as a thick, sweet drink.

This find and others in the last 12 months have created hope for new breath of life into Egypt's mummified tourism sector. In 2010, some 14.7 million tourists came to Egypt. Those figures collapsed in 2011 during and after the Arab Spring; and took another blow from Egypt's military coup in 2016. The industry slowly regrew for the next few years, only to be flattened again by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, the country had 13.1 million tourists; that had shriveled to just 3.5 million in 2020.

The discovery of what the Egyptian tourism ministry is calling ""the oldest high-production brewery in the world,"" at Abydos, near Luxor, could help build a thirst for Egyptian tourism again.

As the discovery of the ""snack bar"" in Pompeii in 2020 proved, culinary finds are very popular with the public. Archaeologist and director of the Burg Linn Museum, Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser agrees: ""As an archaeologist you know what the press loves: All finds that have to do with sex, alcohol or seasonal holidays.""

Ancient treasures found in 2020 Saqqara Saqqara, the necropolis of the city of Memphis, about 30 kilometers south of Cairo, is considered one of most important archaeological sites in Egypt together with the Valley of the Kings and the pyramids of Giza. The settlement struck the headlines this year with yet another spectacular discovery: In September and October, researchers found beautifully decorated wooden coffins.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 Twelve more wooden coffins In November, experts uncovered a dozen more sarcophagi in Saqqara. The beautifully decorated wooden coffins are considered to be over 2,500 years old, Egyptian researchers said. Individual coffins were opened carefully to anaylze their contents.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 Striking rock in Egypt Egyptologists from the University of Bonn discovered an inscription on this rock, believed to be over 5,000 years old. It was discovered in Wadi Abu Subeira, northeast of Aswan. Experts, including those from the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities, found that the rock was actually a town sign from the fourth century BC.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 The ruins of Pompeii The archaeological site of the Roman city of Pompeii, southwards of Naples, surprises the world with new discoveries every now and then. In 79 AD, during the historical volcanic eruption of Mount Vesuvius, mud, ash rain and molten lava buried the place, killing people and animals. Only in the 18th century were archaeologists able to uncover the relics.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 Fast food, Pompeii style Shortly before Christmas, archaeologists in Pompeii presented the most spectacular discovery of the year: a ""thermopolia,"" an antique food stall with a painted counter. Its gaps had small containers, believed to keep food warm,. Dishes made of duck, chicken and other animals were sold here to residents.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 The city wall of Jerusalem There were completely new discoveries in 2020 as well. After a long period of excavation where Jerusalem is located today, a team of experts under German archaeologist Dieter Vieweger uncovered parts of an ancient city wall, which is believed to be from the time of King Herod and the Byzantine period. The discovery confirmed that ancient Jerusalem was much smaller than believed until now.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 A village from the 2nd century Jerusalem is racked by religious and political conflict. The various archaeological layers have stored thousand years of the city's multicultural history. In early 2020 the remains of a village wall were discovered in Jerusalem. Traces of everyday life reveal interesting information about the settlements at the time.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 Old city, new discoveries In November, construction workers at a sewer in Athens stumbled upon the massive head of an ancient sculpture. On close examination, it turned out to be the marble head of the Greek god, Hermes, according to the Greek Ministry of Culture. Experts believe the head could be from the 3rd or the 4th century. Every now and then, an ancient artefact is discovered in Athens' old city.

Ancient treasures found in 2020 The mystery of Stonehenge To this day, we don't know whether Stonehenge was a temple, an ancient sacrificial site or an observatory. But in 2020, researchers found where the monoliths came from. According to a recent study, the sarsen stones, as the massive sandstone blocks are known, originated from a nearby forest called West Woods in southern England. Author: Heike Mund



Cooler climate, falling wine production ‚Äî a beer storm was brewing

In 2011, Morschheiser herself stumbled over the remains of an ancient brewery ‚Äî in Bonn on the banks of the Rhine ‚Äî built by the Romans 2,000 years ago.

""It is a credible idea that there was a move to make drinks more preservable and relatively germ-free, especially 2,000 or 5,000 years ago, when wells, sewage systems and rivers were only partially separated from one another,"" explains Morscheiser.

That might explain why beer brewing became popular thousands of years ago. But how did beer brewing come to be in the area where Germany is today, in Northern and Central Europe?

There are several possible pathways. The Greeks are thought to have learned to brew beer from the Egyptians during the third century BCE, but it's unclear whether the Romans learned from Greeks or from the Egyptians after the Roman conquest in North Africa, in 32 BCE.

The Abydos archaeological site is seen as the oldest high-production beer brewery uncovered to date

In Central Europe, there is evidence that the Celts were fermenting grain to make alcohol around the same time; and it's entirely possible that other European peoples discovered the fermentation process independently.

""Beer and mead were already known to the Celts, but the hype and mass production didn't begin until the middle of the second century AD,"" explains Morscheiser.

'The aqueducts were left to decay, but not the brewing'

Although the Romans may have regarded it as a second class drink, the Teutonic love for beer has remained ever since.

""As far as I can see, brewing has continued since then,"" says Morscheiser.

""It even survived the fall of the Roman Empire ‚Äî the aqueducts were left to decay, but they didn't want to give up brewing beer.""

But beer in Europe was still being fermented on a small scale; and that's the way it would stay until the Middle Ages, when Christian monasteries started to brew larger quantities. It was only with the industrial revolution that Europe began brewing on an industrial scale.

Nowadays, beer is a big tourist drawcard for Germany. That point is abundantly clear every September when around six million tourists usually visit Oktoberfest in Munich.

But the brewery which was recently uncovered by archaeologists in Egypt may have been about making beer for a less cheerful occasion. The head of the excavation, Matthew Adams of New York University, believes it's possible that the brewery's purpose was to provide drinks for the funeral rites of the pharaohs."
72,U.S. FDA investigates multistate cyclospora outbreak linked to Mexican basil,,https://www.freshfruitportal.com/news/2019/07/25/u-s-fda-investigates-cyclospora-outbreak-linked-to-imported-mexican-basil/,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other authorities are investing a multistate outbreak of cyclospora illnesses potentially linked to fresh basil imported from Mexico.

It has advised consumers not to eat basil exported by Siga Logistics de RL de CV located in Morelos, Mexico, and for restaurants, retailers, distributors, importers and suppliers not to sell or serve its basil.

So far there have been 132 illnesses and four hospitalizations, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

The FDA suspects the basil was served at restaurants in four states - Florida, Minnesota, New York, and Ohio.

The cases in the outbreak from Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Wisconsin.

Although the investigation is ongoing, CDC‚Äôs analysis of epidemiologic information indicates that contaminated fresh basil is the ""likely"" cause of the illnesses.

The FDA‚Äôs traceback investigation indicates that the fresh basil available at points of sale where consumers became ill was exported to the U.S. by Siga Logistics. The FDA has requested a voluntary recall and the firm has agreed.

It has also increased import screening on basil and will continue to investigate the cause and source of the outbreak as well as the distribution of products.

As this outbreak investigation continues, the FDA will work with its Mexican food safety regulatory counterparts to better define the cause and source of this outbreak.","In the remote farmlands of Morelos, wildlife can take you by surprise",https://mexiconewsdaily.com/mexicolife/pumas-on-the-farm/,"I was staying at Zenaida and Efra√≠n‚Äôs home in San Agust√≠n, a small pueblo somewhere in Morelos. I‚Äôd shown up a couple of days earlier, unannounced, with Emilio, who was organizing a meeting there.

I was working on a project to document the lives of campesinos in a few states, and Emilio agreed to introduce me to people in the pueblo. When he announced that I needed a place to stay, Zenaida and Efra√≠n kindly offered to let me stay in their home.

The couple grew and harvested nopal, an edible cactus. Like all campesinos I‚Äôve met, they were very poor but very generous. My living situation was pretty basic: I slept on a beat-up old sofa in a tiny room attached to their home.

The kitchen, like almost all kitchens in el campo, was set apart from the home and had a dirt floor. The bathroom, such as it was, was a hundred or so feet from the house. The toilet was just a couple of cinder blocks stacked over a hole in the ground, surrounded by a low wall.

The shower was to the left of it, a couple of feet away, and it was just a short stall also constructed from cinder blocks. A torn old curtain hung over its entrance. To shower, you hauled in really cold water from the well and poured it over yourself when you wanted ‚Äî or needed ‚Äî to get clean.

I spent a day in the field with them, photographing as they harvested. It‚Äôs difficult work, and they wore heavy gloves to protect their hands from the cactus‚Äôs needles. Although it was December, it was hot and the sun felt very strong. This didn‚Äôt seem to faze them, but after a few hours I began to feel a headache coming on.

I sat in the shade of the truck, but the headache worsened. By that evening, it was so painful that it hurt to simply touch my forehead. All I could do was lie down and hope the pain would go away. Efra√≠n bought some aspirin for me, and I guess they worked ‚Äî I went to bed early and, happily, when I awoke the next day, the headache was gone.

It was probably my third night there when I got the urge in the early morning to use the toilet. The yard was partially illuminated with a couple of bare lightbulbs. I really couldn‚Äôt see much, just enough so that I didn‚Äôt bump into anything.

I slowly picked my way across the yard to the toilet. When I was just a couple of feet from it, an animal came bursting out of the shower stall, bolting between me and the toilet. I don‚Äôt think it touched me as it passed, but it came awfully close; there wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of room between me and that toilet.

I stood there and remember thinking, ‚ÄúThat was weird. I wonder what the hell that was?‚Äù

All I thought at the time was that it moved like a cat but that it was way larger. Oddly, I didn‚Äôt feel afraid. Had this happened back in the States, I‚Äôm sure I would‚Äôve run back to bed, pulled the covers over my head and waited until daylight. But hey, I was in Mexico, and I figured this sort of thing happened all the time.

Not knowing what else to do, I used the toilet and went back to bed. I didn‚Äôt say anything to Zenaida or Efra√≠n because I thought they‚Äôd just laugh at me.

I spent a few more days there and then headed back to Mexico City, where I met a friend for a beer. I was telling her about all the times I‚Äôd almost been killed or injured on projects; there have been several.

When I told her this story, I asked her what she thought the animal might have been. She paused a moment.

‚ÄúWhere did this happen?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúMorelos,‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúMorelos?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Morelos.‚Äù

She paused another moment then said, ‚ÄúPuma ‚Ä¶ it was a puma.‚Äù

Fortunately for me, either the puma wasn‚Äôt hungry or was more afraid of me than I was of it. I actually didn‚Äôt feel afraid when it happened back in San Agust√≠n; surprised, but not afraid. That changed when I learned what that animal was.

I had to deal with the knot in my stomach for a couple of days.

74,Costa Rica officials say tainted alcohol kills at least 19,,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7271427/Costa-Rica-officials-say-tainted-alcohol-kills-19.html,"The Costa Rican government has issued a national alert saying that alcohol tainted with methanol is behind the deaths of 19 people.

Five women and 14 men have died after drinking contaminated liquor since early June, according to the government.

The Health Ministry said the victims ranged from 32 to 72 years in age.

While investigations continue, the ministry said in a report that the alcohol had been poisoned with methanol.

The Costa Rican government has issued a national alert saying that alcohol tainted with methanol is behind the deaths of 19 people. They released the above photo showing some of the brands they had seized

The deaths occurred in June and July in the Cost Rican towns of San Jose, Cartago, Limon, Guanacaste and Heredia.

Government officials have seized about 30,000 bottles from brands suspected of containing methanol.

The ministry said it believes the tainted alcohol is just counterfeit products of known brand names.

Those brands seized include Guaro Montano, Guaro Gran Apache, Star Welsh, Aguardiente Bar√≥n Rojo, Aguardiente Timbuka and Aguardiente Molotov.

The government has warned people to avoid these brands as they investigate.

Aguardiente translates to English as 'fire water'. Both it and guaro are traditionally distilled from sugar cane.

Liquor sellers sometimes dilute products with toxic methanol to increase profit margins or raise alcohol content.

Consuming methanol can cause dizziness, drowsiness, headaches and an inability to move muscles.

'It is important to emphasize that this information is preliminary since the investigations continue,' a statement from the ministry said.

'The Ministry of Health continues to carry out operations throughout the national territory in order to reduce the exposure of consumers to adulterated products.'",U.S. Embassy issues security alert over expected protests,https://ticotimes.net/2021/02/22/u-s-embassy-issues-security-alert-over-expected-protests-feb-22,"The United States Embassy in Costa Rica has issued the following security alert regarding expected protests on Monday, February 22:

The U.S. Embassy has received credible open-source information from social media sites indicating several municipalities plan to conduct a protest in front of the Legislative Assembly on Monday, February 22. A specific time for the protest has not yet been announced. According to the information, the group is protesting the new public employment law and negotiations with the IMF. Additionally, the U.S. Embassy has received credible open-source information from local media outlets indicating dozens of tour guides will demonstrate outside the Costa Rican Tourism Institute (ICT) on Monday, February 22. No specific time has been announced. According to the information, the group wants a meeting with Minister of Tourism Gustavo Segura to find a solution to the economic crisis caused by COVID-19

The Embassy recommends avoiding crowds and demonstrations. Click here for the location of the Legislative Assembly building; click here for the location of the ICT headquarters.

More recent reports indicate both gatherings may start at 9 a.m. Monday.

A larger protest movement against the IMF deal was expected to begin last week; however, it largely didn‚Äôt materialize. Monday‚Äôs gathering at the Legislative Assembly is in opposition to employment reform that the government says would help Costa Rica curtail its deficit by simplifying pay structures for public workers.

Tour guides are gathering to condemn what they argue has been inadequate support from the government in context of the coronavirus pandemic.

Protests in Costa Rica are overwhelmingly non-violent."
76,Salmonella from Italian meat sickens 80 in France,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/07/salmonella-from-italian-meat-sickens-80-in-france/,"More than 80 people are ill in France due to a Salmonella outbreak linked to a meat product from Italy.

A spokeswoman from Sant√© Publique France told Food Safety News that 83 people had been infected by Salmonella Typhimurium and 13 of them needed hospital treatment.

Coppa of the brand Di Vittorio supplied by Castelli France, founded in 1991 and based in Marseille, was recalled last week. Sliced or whole Coppa sold between May 17 and July 8 country-wide was part of the recall.

Consumer complaints led the French supermarket Intermarch√© to alert authorities and withdraw the Italian charcuterie from the sale.

Authorities told people who still have the products not to consume them and to take items back to the place of purchase.

Seven children sick

The foodborne outbreak is suspected to be caused by Salmonella Typhimurium in Coppa from Italy, with raw material from France and Germany.

Both men and women aged between 18 to 84 years old are ill while seven children are also sick. The first patient was reported at the start of June and the last so far was early July. Those ill come from five different regions in the country.

Customer complaints were reported to the French General Directorate of Food (DGAL) and then Sant√© Publique France, the country‚Äôs public health agency. Collective food poisoning was reported by health professionals to the Regional Agencies of Health (ARS).

Patients were asked about food consumption before illness onset and Salmonella strains isolated from their stools have been sent to the National Reference Center of Salmonella at the Institut Pasteur for typing.

Symptoms of Salmonella infection typically develop six to 72 hours after exposure to the bacteria and may include fever, chills, diarrhea, cramps, headache, nausea and vomiting. They usually last from four to seven days and most people recover without treatment.

Older adults, children, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness.

Frascati (15 May)

Just 20km south of Rome is Frascati, one of the 17 towns that make up Castelli Romani, surrounded by the Alban hills. When not touring the town‚Äôs wineries and tasting the crisp white wine that‚Äôs made here, explore the Ville Tuscolane, the stately villas built during the late Renaissance and early baroque periods. Many are scattered around the vast, sprawling Parco del Tuscolo, which also harbours an ancient Roman theatre.

Verona (2 June)

The Giro d‚ÄôItalia ends with an exciting time trial on the World Cup Torricelle circuit before finishing in dramatic fashion in Piazza Bra in front of the remarkably well-preserved Verona Arena. Once the cycling circus packs up, that‚Äôs your cue to explore Verona‚Äôs Roman, medieval and Renaissance sights on both sides of the River Adige, including the ancient Roman theatre and the 14th century Domus Mercatorum. Much of Verona‚Äôs pleasure comes from wandering through its historic squares, including Piazza delle Erbe and Piazza Dei Signori. Diehard romantics can always join the crowds at the Casa di Giulietta in front of that balcony.

78,English E. coli cases linked to travel to Egypt,,https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/07/english-e-coli-cases-linked-to-travel-to-egypt/,"Public Health England has issued a warning after almost 20 cases of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection were found in people returning from Egypt this year.

All travelers had been to the Hurghada region of Egypt. A variety of different Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) strains have been detected in visitors to Egypt with STEC O157 and STEC O26 identified amongst them. One person developed hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a type of kidney failure associated with E. coli infection.

Public Health England (PHE) scientists are investigating to understand the cause of the infections.

The agency has given advice to those going to Egypt after 18 people, including children, returned with serious illnesses caused by STEC infections. In 2018, there were 22 cases of STEC in the whole year, and 11 infections in 2017.

Multiple strains; no outbreak

A PHE spokeswoman told Food Safety News that it cannot provide any further information about patients when asked about onset dates and the demographics of those affected.

‚ÄúSo far this year, four cases have been hospitalized and one case has developed HUS. In 2018, five of 22 cases were hospitalized. We use whole genome sequencing to type all strains of STEC in England, and the results do not indicate this is an outbreak, as multiple different strains of STEC have been detected,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúEach case is individually followed up. We do not know the specific source of these infections in Egypt. However, the most common ways people get infected with STEC is through eating contaminated food or water, through person to person spread or through contact with animal feces.‚Äù

The spokeswoman added the agency has told the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) about the cases and notified the Egyptian public health authorities to provide them with information for their investigations.

Symptoms of infection with STEC can include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and cramps. Most people recover without medical treatment, but younger and older people may develop complications of the infection, leading to kidney failure. This condition is called hemolytic uremic syndrome and can be fatal.

The incubation period for E. coli infections can range from three to eight days. Most patients recover within 10 days.

There have been 16 cases of HUS in people, including children, who have been to the Hurghada region of Egypt between 2009 and 2019.

Dr. Nick Phin, deputy director of the National Infection Service at PHE, said it was aware of people returning from Egypt with E. coli infections.

‚ÄúWe are gathering information about those affected to better understand the cause. There are simple precautions that travelers can take. These include ensuring meat is cooked thoroughly, not drinking tap water or ice made from tap water and trying to avoid swallowing water when swimming,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAnyone suffering from diarrhea and vomiting should ensure they keep well hydrated and seek medical advice if their symptoms don‚Äôt improve within 48 hours. They should also avoid preparing or serving food while they have symptoms and thoroughly wash their hands after using the toilet to stop the bug being passed to others.‚Äù

PHE recommendations to travelers include:

where possible, avoid eating salads and uncooked vegetables and only eat fruit they can peel

avoid unpasteurized milk, cheese and ice cream

avoid food left uncovered in warm environments and exposed to flies

ensure all meat is cooked thoroughly before eating, avoid meat that is pink or cold

only drink bottled water or use ice made from bottled/filtered water

wash hands thoroughly after visiting the toilet, and always before preparing or eating food. Alcohol gel can be helpful but not entirely effective when hand washing facilities are not available

The advice also applies to other countries where E. coli infections are common such as Turkey and Spain.

Those include a horticulture farm and an animal production farm, Mousa said pointing out that such projects are the outcome of talks to cooperate in the fields of agriculture and animal production.  

The official added that Egypt grants Sudanese candidates scholarships to join training programs at the Egyptian International Center for Agriculture (EICA). He added that Egypt is eager to transfer expertise to the Sudanese side in the fields of seed production as well as vial and vaccine production to protect livestock and improve output.

Mousa stated that President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi is eager to maintain continuous communication with Sudan and other fellow African states.

In 2019, Egypt started establishing three fish farms and an animal farm in four African countries, said Head of the Project of African Farms, affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Maher Maghraby.


Egypt started establishing fish farms in Algeria, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and an animal production farm in Uganda, Maghraby added in his speech at the meeting of the Parliament's African Affairs Committee, noting that the ministry had received requests from other African countries to establish similar projects.

Maghraby continued that these projects had begun in 1998, noting that Egypt had helped Nigeria when it suffered a famine in the second half of the 20th century.

""These projects were suspended following the 2011 revolution and then were revived over the past few years,"" Maghraby explained.

In February 2018, the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation announced the establishment of a joint Egyptian-Eritrean farm in Eritrea, the seventh joint farming project between Egypt and fellow African countries, Egypt’s state-owned news agency reported.

In Togo, the Egyptian-Togolese Joint Farm project was launched in November 2017.

During recent years, the Egyptian Ministry of Agriculture in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs focused on cooperating with African countries in many fields especially agriculture.

In an attempt to enhance the competitive ability of the African countries’ produce and their economic development, the Ministry of Agriculture has established joint model farms with African countries. The project aims to carry out joint agricultural research to increase agricultural productions in Africa."

About E. coli infections

Anyone who has eaten or handled the recalled bison and developed symptoms of E. coli infection should seek medical attention. People should tell their doctors about the possible exposure to E. coli because special tests are required to diagnose it.

The symptoms of E. coli infections vary for each person but often include severe stomach cramps and bloody diarrhea. If there is fever, it is usually not lower than 101 degrees F (38.5 degrees C). Most patients recover within five to seven days. Others can develop severe or even life-threatening symptoms and complications.

About 5 percent to 10 percent of those who are diagnosed with E. coli infections develop a potentially life-threatening kidney failure complication, known as a hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Symptoms of HUS include fever, abdominal pain, feeling very tired, decreased frequency of urination, small unexplained bruises or bleeding, and pallor.

Many people with HUS recover within a few weeks, but some suffer permanent injuries or death. This condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children younger than 5 years old because of their immature immune systems, older adults because of deteriorating immune systems, and people with compromised immune systems such as cancer patients.

People who experience HUS symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. People with HUS should be hospitalized because it can cause other serious and ongoing problems such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, brain damage, and neurologic problems.

FDA suggestions for businesses

In the event that retailers and/or other foodservice operators are found to have handled recalled or other potentially contaminated food in their facilities, they should:

Contact their local health department and communicate to their customers regarding possible exposure to a pathogen.

81,"Outbreak of Salmonella Infections Linked to Cavi Brand Whole, Fresh Papayas",,https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/uganda-06-19/index.html,"Investigation Details

September 12, 2019

CDC, public health and regulatory officials in several states, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)external icon investigated a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Uganda infections.

A total of 81 people infected with the outbreak strain of Salmonella Uganda were reported from nine states. A list of the states and the number of cases in each is on the Map of Reported Cases page.

Illnesses started on dates ranging from January 14, 2019, to July 16, 2019. Most illnesses occurred since April 2019. Ill people ranged in age from less than one year to 90 years, with a median age of 62. Of ill people, 54% were female. Of 51 people with available information, 27 (53%) were hospitalized. No deaths attributed to Salmonella were reported. Of 48 ill people with available information, 31 (65%) were of Hispanic ethnicity.

Whole genome sequencing analysis of 66 bacterial isolates from ill people predicted antibiotic resistance to streptomycin and sulfisoxazole. Testing of four clinical isolates using standard antibiotic susceptibility testing methods by CDC‚Äôs National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) showed one isolate with resistance to streptomycin and three isolates with no resistance. This resistance does not affect the choice of antibiotic used to treat most people.

Investigation of the Outbreak

Epidemiologic and traceback evidence indicates that Cavi brand whole, fresh papayas imported from Mexico were the likely source of this outbreak.

In interviews, ill people answered questions about the foods they ate and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 34 people who were interviewed, 25 (74%) reported eating papayas. This proportion was significantly higher than the proportion found on a survey pdf icon[PDF ‚Äì 787 KB] of healthy Hispanic people in the months of January through June in which 13% reported eating papayas in the week before they were interviewed.

Two ill people in Florida and one ill person in Texas reported eating papayas during travel to the Northeast in the week before they got sick. This provided additional evidence that papayas were the likely source of this outbreak.

The FDA and regulatory officials in several states collected records from grocery stores where ill people reported buying papayas. These records showed that Cavi brand papayas, distributed by Agroson‚Äôs LLC of The Bronx, New York, N.Y., were sold at multiple grocery stores where ill people bought papayas.

As of September 12, 2019, this outbreak appears to be over.",Is it safe to drink water after eating papaya?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/is-it-safe-to-drink-water-after-eating-papaya/photostory/78235797.cms,"Food combinations can be quite confusing, especially when related to one of the most nutritious fruits- Papaya.
